However, at the policy-relevant scale of protected areas, we know little about how the spatial distribution of prey depletion affects carnivore space use and population persistence. We developed a spatially explicit, agent-based model to investigate the effects of different human-induced prey depletion experiments on the globally endangered tiger (Panthera tigris) in isolated protected areas—a situation that prevails throughout the tiger's range. Specifically, we generated 120 experiments that varied the spatial extent and intensity of prey depletion across a stylized (circle) landscape (1,000 km2) and Nepal's Chitwan National Park (~1,239 km2). Experiments that created more spatially homogenous prey distributions (i.e., less prey removed per cell but over larger areas) resulted in larger tiger territories and smaller population sizes over time. Counterintuitively, we found that depleting prey along the edge of Chitwan National Park, while decreasing tiger numbers overall, also decreased female competition for those areas, leading to lower rates of female starvation. Overall our results suggest that subtle differences in the spatial distributions of prey densities created by various human activities, such as natural resource-use patterns, urban growth and infrastructure development, or conservation spatial zoning might have unintended, detrimental effects on carnivore populations. Our model is a useful planning tool as it incorporates information on animal behavioral ecology, resource spatial distribution, and the drivers of change to those resources, such as human activities. © 2019 The Authors.

The 12th Meeting of the Central Finance and Economics Leading Group proposed to integrate the main habitat of giant pandas, establish the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park and solve cross-regional and cross-sectoral institutional problems. The Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park is an important environment where big cats and humans live together. The management and zoning of the park should fully consider not only the habitat environment for tigers and leopards, but also the habitat environment and safety for human beings. Based on the overall consideration of sensitivity, endangerment and distribution characteristics of protected objects, migration and reproduction characteristics of tigers and leopards and other big cats, production and living utilization status of residents and social development needs, Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park proposed to adopt the Zoning-based Management and Control Mode for the first time. Through the factor extraction and analysis of the resources, environment, economic and social background in the region, the park uses GIS technology to extract and analyze the factors. It has been found that, according to the three principles of ecosystem, integrity, authenticity and coordination of protection and development, the park mainly aims to implement differential control over human activities, and the protection mechanism divides the control zones. The Zoning-based Management and Control Mode. The Zoning control enables the park to properly handle the relationship between the protection of the habitat of Amur tigers and Amur leopards and the maintenance of border security and stability, the production and life of indigenous residents. It also can make the park realize the harmonious coexistence and common development between man and nature. © 2022","Amur leopard; Amur tiger; National park; Range; Zoning","China; biodiversity; canid; habitat management; park management; rangeland; species conservation; zoning policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126531080"

To balance the needs of conservation and development, the national parks will adopt a zoning designation to delimit land in the parks for different purposes. These include a core zone that covers critical areas for conservation and allows few human uses, and a control zone that permits a wider range of development activities. However, the efficacy and management challenges of this zoning scheme are largely unknown. Using the Giant Panda National Park (GPNP) in Sichuan Province as an example, we evaluated the efficacy of the park's zoning designations by assessing the spatial distribution of critical habitat areas for panda conservation and human disturbance across different zones. Our results show that the core zone of the GPNP performs well in covering the majority of panda habitat (80%), highly suitable habitat (81%), and habitat patches that can support a viable panda population (80%). There is still space for improvement, however, because a significant portion (39%) of the potential corridors that require strict protections fall outside the core zone. Human disturbances are prevalent in the core zone of the park, representing a major challenge to achieving the management goal of eliminating human disturbances in the core zone. Our analyses and methods provide crucial information and tools to inform the design and management of the zoning designations of the GPNP and other PAs in China and beyond. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Giant Panda National Park; Habitat connectivity; Habitat suitability; Human disturbances; Protected areas; Zoning designations","Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Trachinotus falcatus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099612828"

National park planning should aim to achieve conservation goals, leam from nature reserve zoning and itemize management objectives for sub-zoning, and learn from scenic area planning to take a landscapce value into consideration and balance socio-economic conditions, especially land tenure. It then should consider climate change and regional development goals in the long term to finalize the theoretical system. In the formation of the theory, realizing different ecosystem service bundles could be the target of spatial control. Under certain land tenure systems, ecological protection and community livelihood development could be balanced by implementing conservation easements to separate land ownership, use rights, and benefit rights to restrain community land use in certain areas with compensation. © 2019 Science Press.

We applied a systematic conservation planning tool, Marxan with Zones, and stakeholder consultation to design and revise the draft zoning plan. This process was facilitated by Sabah Parks, a government agency, and WWF-Malaysia, under the guidance of the Tun Mustapha Park steering committee and with support from the University of Queensland. Four conservation and fishing zones, including no-take areas, were developed, each with representation and replication targets for key marine habitats, and a range of socio-economic and community objectives. Here we report on how decision-support tools informed the reserve design process in three planning stages: prioritization, government review, and community consultation. Using marine habitat and species representation as a reporting metric, we describe how the zoning plan changed at each stage of the design process. We found that the changes made to the zoning plan by the government and stakeholders resulted in plans that compromised the achievement of conservation targets because no-take areas were moved away from villages and the coastline, where unique habitats are located. The design process highlights a number of lessons learned for future conservation zoning, which we believe will be useful as many other places embark on similar zoning processes on land and in the sea.

The site of work was chosen on the basis of the previously carried out ecological and geomorphological zoning of the slopes of the Aibga Ridge (Sochi National Park) and represents the slopes of the Chernaya Piramida mountain covered with forest and alpine meadows. A fragment of the ridge slope in the area of an ancient stabilized seismogenic gravitational landslide was studied. The morphology of the relief was partially changed during the construction of sports facilities – ski slopes and cable cars. The creation of clearings in forests, a partial change in the morphology of the natural relief and surface runoff conditions led to local activation of landslide processes, including on ski slopes and other infrastructure facilities. The newly formed landslide slopes are confined to the junction of natural and man-made relief forms: the ski slopes and the slopes of the hollows of temporary watercourses. As a result of field work using the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), a local reference geodetic network of centimeter accuracy was formed – a planned-altitude substantiation (PVO), which served as a geodetic basis for processing sounding materials and subsequent geoinformation mapping. Aerial sounding was carried out using the DJI Mavic 2 Pro and DJI Mini UAVs, more than 1,000 digital images of the study area in nadir and prospective have been accumulated. In addition, in order to identify the relief forms of the underlying surface on separate fragments of the study area, covered with dense broad-leaved forest (beech, hornbeam), a tacheometric survey was carried out.

The compromise is often difficult to reach, which causes conflicts over the management priorities of existing and potential protected areas. Ecosystem services (ES) perspective offers a promising avenue for diagnosing and reconciling contrasting interests concerning the use of benefits from ecosystems. We examined how the spatial proximity to the Białowieża Forest (BF), a European biodiversity hotspot, affects the perceived use of ES by local communities. We performed a survey among 719 respondents from 35 villages situated within BF and in its vicinity. We found that both the declared use of ES and the perceived influence of ES on household's economy was declining with the distance from BF with particularly high differences between areas not further than 3 km from BF and areas located 3-15 km from BF. Different zones varied in terms of benefits from tourism and costs connected with a potential limited access to ES due to conservation. Broadening the perspective, we argue that the trade-offs linked to ES may vary depending on the location in relation to the protected area and that local communities should not be treated as a homogenous group when considering benefits from the forest. Awareness of common patterns of ES use over space and local specificity may enhance effective management of even highly contested conservation areas. © 2020 The Authors","Biodiversity conservation; Conservation; Ecosystem services; Local resource use; Management; National park; Natura 2000; Perceptions; Planning; Protected areas; Spatial analysis; Tourism; Zoning","biodiversity; ecosystem service; environmental protection; forest management; nature conservation; protected area","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086025672"

The results show that: (1) Grassland in Qinghai area of Qilian Mountain National Park was above 55.00%, and the total area transferred between land use types in Qinghai area of Qilian Mountain National Park during 30 years (1998—2018) was 102.49 km2, among which the largest area of medium-coverage grassland was transferred out, which was 34. 83 km2, and the largest area of artificial grassland was transferred in, which was 24.61 km2. (2) The ecosystem service value (ESV) of the Qinghai area of Qilian Mountains National Park in three periods (1998, 2008, 2018) was about 27.4 billion yuan/year, and the ecosystem service value per unit area was 1.7294 million yuan/km2. The water and wetland ecosystems contributed the largest amount of ecosystem service value, accounting for more than 44. 00%, and the alpine river source wetlands and cold temperate coniferous forests were the high value areas of ecosystem service value. (3) The landscape ecological risk index (ERI) of the Qinghai Area of Qilian Mountain National Park in 1998, 2008 and 2018 were 0. 2287, 0. 2286 and 0. 2310, respectively, with an overall good ecological safety status. The landscape ecological risk is dominated by low ecological risk level and lower ecological risk level, accounting for about 90. 00%. The landscape ecological risk level of artificial grassland, dry land and construction land is higher. (4) The Qinghai area of the Qilian Mountains National Park was divided into four types of ecological spatial zones: ecologically secure habitat restoration zone (I), ecologically fragile special protection zone (II), ecologically improved development and utilization zone (III), and ecologically preventive conservation and nurturing zone (IV), based on two dimensions of ecosystem service value and landscape ecological risk.

It is necessary to develop scientific land-use management strategies in the Three-River Headwaters Region to achieve the goal of sustainable land development. This study selected six vital ecosystem services (ESs) for the study area namely, water supply, carbon sequestration, soil retention, sand fixation, hydrological regulation, and flood mitigation to quantify and map the spatiotemporal distributions of these ecosystem services during 2000–2018. We also mapped the spatial distribution of biodiversity protection importance in the Three-River Headwaters Region using the MaxEnt model. We further identified the priority conservation areas through the combination of biodiversity and six ecosystem services with different area thresholds and compared the conservation efficiencies in the Sanjiangyuan National Park and the current protected areas in the Three-River Headwaters Region. In addition, we evaluated the relationships between ecosystem services and biodiversity protection importance and the impacts of eleven environmental factors (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index, elevation, slope, temperature, precipitation; wind speed, solar radiation, the proportion of forest land, the proportion of grassland, the proportion of cropland, and the proportion of wetland) on them. Finally, we identified the functional zones based on the ecosystem services-biodiversity bundles and proposed the corresponding management schemes. The results showed that the spatial distributions of six ecosystem services and biodiversity protection importance in the Three-River Headwaters Region were not spatially congruent. With the changes in the area thresholds in extracting priority conservation areas, the protection focus in the Sanjiangyuan National Park and the current protected areas should be updated accordingly. We identified eight ecosystem services-biodiversity bundles in the Three-River Headwaters Region and divided them into five ecological functional zones, based on which then the corresponding zoning optimization management schemes in each bundle and function zone were proposed. Comprehensive consideration of ecosystem services and biodiversity protection importance is insightful for other regions to conserve biodiversity and exploit natural resources simultaneously. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity protection; Ecological security; Ecosystem service; Priority conservation area; Three-river headwaters region","Conservation; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Land use; Rivers; Slope protection; Spatial distribution; Water supply; Wind; 'current; Area threshold; Biodiversity protection; Conservation areas; Ecological security; Ecosystem services; National parks; Priority conservation area; Service protections; Three-rivers headwater regions; Biodiversity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129961405"

The national park is being developed in accordance with the environmental legislation provided for economic activities within such protected areas. The purpose of the creation of the national park was the need to preserve the diversity of landscapes of the Tunkinsky mountain valley and the mountain ranges surrounding it, the protection of biodiversity, natural, historical and cultural monuments in combination with tourism. The regulation of the use of the park territory is carried out in accordance with its functional zoning for environmental education, scientific, recreational and limited economic purposes. The study area has long been a place of traditional use of natural resources. Here people hunted, fished, grazed cattle, gathered wild plants, people settled along the banks of lakes and rivers. In the Soviet years, this area received intensive recreational development due to active tourist development, which was facilitated by good transport accessibility and the existing settlement infrastructure. A sociological survey, as well as conversations in local administration bodies, showed that such types of economic activity as agriculture, cattle breeding, recreation (serving tourists), gathering, crafts, etc. remain the main ones in the livelihood of the local population. All these forms of economic activity affect nature in different ways, transform it. The practical significance of the research lies in the possibility of using the results of the study by various organizations, including administrative bodies of any level, to assess the current socio-economic situation and forecast its development, to prevent conflicts in nature resource management, to make effective decisions in management, choosing strategies for the possible development of the territory. © 2022 Lomonosov Moscow State University.

However, land managers of most protected areas can barely identify whether the zones they manage are ideally designated due to lack of clear information related to the protected objects as well as other related in-situ conservation information on a regional scale. Here we focused on 26 protected areas at national and local levels that have mainly been designated to protect the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in Sichuan Province, China. The management zones of these protected areas included core, buffer, and experiment zones. We used five indicators to test the spatial differentiation among management zones, including the area of each management zone (Area), the proportion of a zone that overlapped with other protected areas (Overlap proportion), the number of giant pandas present (Panda number), the density of giant pandas (Panda density), and the proportion of the concentrated distribution areas for giant panda (CDA proportion). The results showed that Area and Panda number of the core zone were significantly higher than the buffer zone (P = 0.000) and the experiment zone (0.000 ≤ P ≤ 0.001); Panda density in the core zone (P = 0.006) and buffer zone (P = 0.009) were significantly higher than in the experiment zone. Meanwhile, the buffer zone had the highest Panda density (7.71 individuals/100 km2) and the experiment zone had the highest CDA proportion (42.19%). Nevertheless, no significant differences were observed in the five indicators between the national and local protected areas (0.058 ≤ P ≤ 1). The concentrated distribution area for giant panda accounted for 36.66% of these 26 protected areas, covering nearly 80% of the population of wild giant pandas, while the previous core zones (accounting for 62.84% of the 26 protected areas) only covered 66.12% of the population of wild giant pandas. Thus, we suggested that the concentrated distribution area of giant panda should be designated as the main area of the functional zone and be designated mainly for conserving biodiversity that is represented by giant panda in the Sichuan area of Giant Panda National Park; in addition, the local protected areas should be given more attention during the reform of China's protected area system. © 2020 The Authors","Endemic species; Management zone; National park; Nature reserve; Protection efficiency; Sichuan","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098230092"

Better functional zoning is of great significance to the protection of ecosystem legitimacy and integrity, the appropriate utilization of resources, community integration, and feasible management. In the present study, the proposed Qinghai Lake National Park is the research object. Based on the critical goal of ecological protection, the importance of ecosystem service functions and the ecological sensitivities were evaluated. The results showed that the ecosystem service functions and the ecological sensitivity of the whole region are high. Among them, lake, river and wetland as the most strictly protected ecosystems account for the highest proportion. Then this study divided the proposed Qinghai Lake National Park into five functional areas through grid calculations, spatial analysis and multifactor trade-off. The results indicated that the goal of functional zoning for national park is to maximize the overall utility of park protection value and its comprehensive functions based on its spatial units with different functions, management and control requirements. The zoning scheme addresses the lack of sustainable development in Qinghai Lake National Park due to ecological environmental changes and single-resource zoning with resource protection as the primary goal.

In this way, multiple regional economic, social and ecological benefits can be realized. Of course, unreasonable and high-intensity production and living (tourism) activities of human beings will cause irreversible negative effects. Therefore, paying attention to the environmental stress process and its spatial effects brought about by human activities under the background of national park construction is of great significance for coordinating the man-land coupling system and improving the sustainability of key eco-function zones. Taking the Three-River-Source National Park (TRSNP) region as a typical case study, based on the spatial identification of anthropogenic pollution and the estimation of water and air pollutant emissions, this study quantitatively evaluates the environmental stress intensity and analyzes its spatial effects from the perspective of “point-line-plane” stress characteristics. The results show that the effect of environmental stress from anthropogenic pollutants on the TRSNP region is relatively low but shows significant spatial differentiation. The stress intensity in central cities (towns) is relatively high, and the four counties where national parks are located account for only 1/2 of the average stress intensity. From 2012 to 2016, urbanization and industrialization showed significant “point-like” environmental stress; agriculture and animal husbandry production increased the “plane-like” stress; and tourism and transportation showed a “line-like” stress, shifting from points to lines. It is recommended to formulate management and control measures to alleviate the environmental stress intensity in important ecological function areas from four aspects: improving the carrying capacity of environmental facilities, establishing a functional zoning control system, implementing environmental regulations for production and living, and standardizing the environmental ethics and moral concepts of the whole society. © 2021","Anthropogenic pollutants; Environmental stress; National park; Spatial effects; Three-river-source region","Agriculture; Environmental regulations; Parks; Regional planning; River pollution; Sustainable development; Anthropogenic pollutants; Anthropogenics; Ecological production; Environmental stress; Living spaces; National parks; Spatial effect; Spatio-temporal; Stress intensity; Three-river-source region; Rivers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111758298"

Here, we examine the different values and beliefs that influence how diverse stakeholders perceive the rezoning process and the subsequent implications for marine conservation. Our research draws on 55 semi-structured key informant interviews (e.g., with communities, scientists, government), as well as a focus group with managers and staff from the South African conservation management authority. Results highlight the conditions through which values and beliefs about the MPA and the zoning effort have been mediated: 1) the historic (i.e., Apartheid) context in which the TNP MPA was created; 2) the disciplinary background, knowledge and lived experience of those involved in the rezoning; and 3) the underlying socio-economic circumstances that affect values and beliefs. Our research also reveals the entrenched perceptions (positive and negative) about the socio-cultural, ecological, regulatory and governance outcomes of rezoning. Ultimately, more collaborative efforts are necessary to reconcile diverse values and beliefs among different stakeholders, and to balance community rights with conservation rezoning objectives. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

In this study, a geographical attribute code and basic zoning elements are developed for the proposed “Ailaoshan-Wuliangshan” National Park, followed by the development of spatial multi-criteria sets and weight sets to determine the suitability of the land. Next, we use a clustering algorithm and conflict unit prioritization to allocate space for multi-target units to get the preliminary zoning schemes, and then identify stable units and unstable units through sensitivity analysis. Ultimately, the functional zoning of the National Park was determined. According to the results, the proposed “Ailaoshan-Wuliangshan” National Park can be divided into nine types of 164 landscape units; the highest land suitability values of each zone showed the traits of differentiation and aggregation in spatial distribution; there are 97 stable units and 67 unstable units; approximately 62.83% and 37.17% of the total park area can be divided into core conservation area (primary sensitive area and secondary sensitive area) and general control area (ecological activity area and ecological control area). By implementing a comprehensive assessment and decision-making process, the defined functional zones are precise and simple to recognize on the ground, and they adhere to the area proportions needed by national standards. Furthermore, the functional zoning is clustered, which avoids the fragmentation of the zoning results causing difficulties in management, and serves as a point of reference for the functional zoning approaches used in other proposed national parks in China. © 2022 by the authors.","functional zoning; landscape unit; multi-criteria decision analysis; national park","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141883347"

However, to promote the coordinated development of economic construction and ecological protection of protected areas, their management needs to be more comprehensive and refined. Therefore, a more quantitative and refined spatial planning and management method for protected areas is urgently needed. This study took Sanjiangyuan National Park as the research object and considered the three biodiversity elements of species, ecosystems and landscape. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, and Fragstats software were used to determine the areas with highly suitable species habitat, areas of high ecosystem service value and areas of high landscape diversity. Based on these areas, Marxan software was used to calculate the irreplaceability value, identify the boundary of Sanjiangyuan National Park and clarify the gaps of the existing Sanjiangyuan National Park in the space. We suggest that at least 18,569 km2 of the eastern part of the Sanjiangyuan Region with a high irreplaceability value should be included in the existing Sanjiangyuan National Park. Moreover, the first-level zones were also classified based on irreplaceability, and the second-level functional zones were classified by K-means clustering based on the evaluation of ecological vulnerability and economic construction suitability. The first-level zones include “core conservation zones” and “general control zones”, which had areas of 71,758.20 km2 (57.99%) and 51,980.13 km2 (42.01%), respectively. The core conservation zones were further zoned into primary vulnerable zones and secondary vulnerable zones. The subzones of the general control zones are multifunctional and they are tourism-grazing-living zones, grazing-living zones, tourism-living zones, tourism zones and other areas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Boundary delineation; Ecosystem services; Landscape diversity; Sanjiangyuan National Park; Species habitat suitability; Zoning","Biodiversity; China; City Planning; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Parks, Recreational; China; Qinghai; Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Grading; K-means clustering; Maximum entropy methods; Site selection; Zoning; Boundary delineation; Classifieds; Economic constructions; Ecosystem services; Habitat suitability; Landscape diversity; National parks; Protected areas; Sanjiangyuan national park; Species habitat suitability; biodiversity; conservation; ecosystem service; environmental policy; functional group; habitat quality; landscape structure; maximum entropy analysis; national park; protected area; software; zoning system; article; biodiversity; ecosystem; ecosystem service value; ecosystem vulnerability; grazing; k means clustering; landscape; maximum entropy model; national park; software; species habitat; tourism; biodiversity; China; city planning; ecosystem; environmental protection; procedures; recreational park; Environmental protection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125447867"

The principle of “ecological protection first and public welfare a priority” indicates that both biodiversity and ecosystem services are essential. The “China national parks for people” project was, therefore, launched to practice an ecosystem services approach in national park planning so that scientists, practitioners and decision makers could communicate using a science-policy-practice interface (SPPI). By linking ecosystem services to the social demand of their beneficiaries through the economic definition, we set a conceptual framework for China national park construction that may also be applicable to other developing countries facing similar conservation challenges so that rural livelihood is not negligible regarding conservation. This study focuses on reducing trade-offs between ecosystem services that are important for local livelihood and that are, generally, public goods in a national park pilot. A technical route is proposed starting from the identification of beneficiaries through to regulating community behaviour using ecosystem services mapping, assessment and governance analyses. It is hypothesized that this approach will assist in national park zoning and land management, and this approach is designed to trigger increased discussion on benefit sharing in future national parks, e.g., the Wuyishan pilot, where this research was performed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Institutional change; National park; Science-policy-practice interface; Socio-ecological system","China; Biodiversity; Decision making; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Ecosystem services; Institutional change; National parks; Science policies; Socio-ecological systems; conceptual framework; ecosystem approach; ecosystem service; institutional reform; national park; policy approach; science and technology; article; China; conceptual framework; developing country; ecosystem; human; human experiment; national park; Ecosystems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048305158"

NPs were mainly created to preserve the landscape-forming biotopes. Siberian and Far Eastern NPs were founded in the late 1980s or early 1990s. As a result, previously human-populated or otherwise affected areas that contained settlements, logging sites, mining sites, collective farms, and other economic facilities were transformed into national parks. A national park is supposed to provide venue for research and recreation, which is at odds with the locals' economic activities. Irrational recreational use of NP areas degrades the plant communities: Vulnerable species vanish, less vulnerable replace them, and meadow species become widespread in forest ecosystems; it also negatively affects the soil cover as it destroys the ground litter of soils, makes the humus horizon shallow and too dense, ultimately killing the soil microflora. This is the case of nearly any NP in Siberia and the Far East, which calls for well-thought-out economic zoning of areas that would be environmentally, economically, and legally sound. It is on this basis that this paper proposes a socioeconomic development concept (the Concept) for the Tunkinsky NP. © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Biodiversity; Conservation; Economics; Ecosystems; Forestry; Plants (botany); Soils; Anthropogenic impacts; Economic activities; Forest ecosystem; Natural environments; Plant communities; Protected areas; Socio-economic development; Soil microflora; Economic and social effects","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102749671"

These parks should be unique areas with large nature core zones and unique landscapes in order to acquire international allure that attracts sustainable economic activities. Land use and regional activities should support these goals. The existing national parks do not meet this new standard. Therefore parks are now looking for a new balance in a development-oriented way of nature and landscape protection in order to improve the quality of nature, landscape and liveability. The transition produces a diverse palette on approaches ranging from small strict nature reserves to large-scale areas including cities. Suggested boundaries are based on landscape ecological criteria or on administrative boundaries. Despite given guidelines the criteria are apparently open to multiple interpretations. We advise to implement a national park zoning model for land use. The core and bufferzone should exceed a minimum of 10.000 hectares nature. The outer border of the transition zone can be fluid. The design of borders of the zones of a new national park should be based on ecological, historical and landscape criteria. © 2022 Werkgemeenschap Landschapsecologisch Onderzoek.

The purpose of this paper was to provide information to guide wetland park functional zoning and to formulate the water pollution prevention and control strategy. In this study, 53 sampling points of 6 national wetland parks in Suzhou City were selected. Pearson’s correlation analysis, multiple stepwise regression analysis, redundancy analysis, single factor, and comprehensive water quality identification index methods were used to analyze the effects of wetland landscape types and landscape configuration on water quality. (1) Lakes and rivers in the wetland park had positive ecological effects and should be distributed in each functional zone. (2) Grassland ecology is fragile. Grasslands should be distributed in conservation areas and in restoration and reconstruction areas. (3) Woodland and cultivated land have both ecological and economic benefits. They can be used as ecological buffer and entertainment zones, which are respectively distributed in the restoration and reconstruction areas and in the reasonable utilization areas.

The various aspects of the green economy and green development identified by them, including geographical, economic, social, and environmental ones, as well as their interconnections, are given. Green development is the economic development or development of a certain territory in which technogenic and anthropogenic impacts on the environment are minimized and the biodiversity of its landscapes and, in general, its green vegetation is preserved. It is suggested that green development should be treated as the first stages in achieving sustainable development. In order to implement certain incentives and governance, it is proposed to identify territories for green development. It is thought that one of their most important components is the existence of specially protected natural areas and their combinations, such as nature reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, protected areas, and significant areas of wildlife. A green economy should become predominant, ensuring a rise in production with a reduction in energy consumption and an improvement of the standard of living with reductions in resources used and technogenic pressure on ecosystems and biodiversity. Taking into consideration these criteria, as well as approaches to the natural and economic zoning on the territory of Primorskii krai, five territories (zones) were identified that hold promise for green development. The characteristic of the natural resource potential of the selected territories and of their existing specialization is provided, and the priority types of economic activities that are compatible with green development are determined. The establishment of a special status (“territory of green development”) is suggested. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","green economy; natural and economic areas; Primorskii krai; specially protected natural areas; sustainable development; wildlife","Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Rome; economic development; green economy; living standard; natural resource; protected area; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; wild population","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143526745"

The dynamics of zoning of the Losiny Ostrov National Park from 1988 to 2012 was assessed from the position of environmental regimes using open-access data. Using GIS technologies, the estimated dynamic schemes of environmental restrictions were obtained. The tendency to easing regulations clearly exists: the weighted average dynamic parameter of environmental value is –3.27 (possible values vary from –20 to 20). The 2012 version established stronger transformations of environmental restrictions than in 2010 (dynamic indicators are –0.62 and –2.65, respectively). The greatest negative changes for natural complexes are associated with the allocation of a historical and cultural zone, the transformation of third-party user sites into economic zones, the expansion of the recreational zone, and the disappearance of the educational and excursion zone. Differences between Moscow city and the adjacent Moscow region are negligible. However, there is considerable disparity between current zoning of urban and regional parts of the park (restriction indicators are 7.41 and 12.17, respectively). Urban space is more oriented towards recreation, indicating an incompatibility with the status of a national park. In contrast to the outer 1000-meter belt, the central part of the park has had greater deterioration of nature restrictions. The weighted average indicator of ecosystem compliance (environmental restrictions and vulnerability of natural complexes) is 3.3 (possible values range from –20 to 20), which points to a sufficient level of compliance with the functional zoning of landscape vulnerability. This accordance is more typical of inner part of the park inner and territories within the boundary of Moscow. © 2022 St. Petersburg University Press.

The growing concern about habitat loss has spurred China's national park project to shift from pilot to construction phase with the official establishment of China's first group of national parks (CFGNPs) in October 2021. But far too little attention has been paid to the synergistic work concerning the habitat quality (HQ) dynamics of all five national parks. Here, the InVEST model, combined with a satellite-derived land use and land cover product and a hot spot analysis (HSA) method, was used to investigate the HQ dynamics at the park- and pixel-scale within the CFGNPs. Our results demonstrate that the past ecological conservation practices within national parks have been unpromising, especially in Giant Panda National Park, Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park (NCTL), and Wuyi Mountain National Park (WYM), where HQ as a whole showed a significant decline. Furthermore, more than half of Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park (87.2%), WYM (77.4%), and NCTL (52.9%) showed significant HQ degradation from 1980 to 2019. Besides, increasing trends in the area shares of HQ degraded pixels were observed in all five national parks from 1980–1999 to 2000–2019. The HSA implied that the hot spots of high HQ degradation rates tend to occur in areas closer to urban settlements or on the edge of national parks, where human activities are intensive. Despite these disappointing findings, we highlighted from the observed local successes and the HQ plateau that the construction of CFGNPs is expected to reverse the deteriorating HQ trends. Thus, we concluded our paper by proposing an HSA-based regulatory zoning scheme that includes five subzones to guide the future construction of China's national park system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Habitat quality; Hot spot analysis; InVEST; Land use and land cover; National parks; Protected areas","Biodiversity; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Parks, Recreational; China; Hainan; conservation status; habitat loss; habitat quality; land cover; land use; national park; spatiotemporal analysis; article; China; giant panda; habitat quality; human; land use; leopard; mountain; national park; nonhuman; tiger; tropical rain forest; biodiversity; China; ecosystem; environmental protection; procedures; recreational park","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140139518"

With the number of foreign tourists entering Thailand during 2020 and 2021 greatly diminished, the number of tourists at marine and coastal attractions in Southern Thailand has declined as well. This study found evidence of a relationship between the decline of the number of tourists and marine resource recovery. This recovery appears in the form of cleaner beaches, clearer seawater and increased sighting of marine animals. Between 2020 and 2021, official reports found increased sighting of dugongs, dolphins, blacktip reef sharks, whale sharks, leopard sharks, sea turtles, green turtles, hawksbill turtles, and false killer whales at marine national parks in Southern Thailand. The study also found that, prior to the COVD-19 outbreak, the number of tourists at Patong Beach and Maya Bay exceeded their tourism carrying capacities. Finally, this study proposes eight policy measures related to tourism management for marine resource sustainability: conservation and recreation zoning, enforcing marine park closure, redesigning marine park entrance fee systems, ensuring adequate recreational facilities, stricter enforcement of the law, promoting alternative tourism sites, encouraging more inclusivity and participation in decision making processes, and enhancing public awareness. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Marine resource recovery; Marine resource sustainability; Sustainable tourism management; Thailand","Thailand; COVID-19; decision making; ecotourism; health policy; marine park; marine resource; sustainability; tourism management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123805763"

The extensiveness of nine municipalities in the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park (PEST—acronym in portuguese) within the limits of the Park, along with the development of cities, displays many interests and land conflicts in the Park. This situation forced, in 2009, governmental parties to establish a new demarcation process, aiming the removal of conflict areas and creation of new categories of protected areas. In this context, this paper aims to report the PEST history, collecting environmental characteristics and land use owned by the environmental protection area of surrounding coastal of the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park, in the northeastern portion of the Baixada Massiambu, the locations of the Pinheira and Guarda do Embaú beaches, in city of Palhoça/SC, Brazil. On this regard, a literature research was performed, referring to the uses of the area under study, as well as the legal and territory definitions; then, field visits were performed from March 2012 to March 2014, and finally, data collected were aggregated using geographic information systems, along with data regarding the ecological and legal characteristics of the area. Results displayed 6501 plots of land on the Pinheira and Guarda do Embaú beaches, and of these, 77% had no environmental restrictions, 13% had partial restrictions, and 10% presented total restrictions. Thus, the PEST delimitation demonstrated great ecological significance for human settlement, especially in some detached areas, which should be kept and preserved. This work makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of the Baixada Massiambu problem, mainly related to land use; protective measures and environmental recovery can be formulated in this region, taking into consideration aspects such as environmental planning and mechanisms of reorganization discussion for this territory. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Demarcations; Environmental cadastre; Environmental protected area of surrounding coastal of Serra do Tabuleiro State Park; Environmental restrictions; Socioeconomic conflicts","Brazil; Portugal; coastal zone; environmental planning; environmental protection; GIS; land use change; national park; protected area; socioeconomic conditions","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042754736"

In order to create protected areas, the issue of area management is discussed and zoning in the management of parks and protected areas is a solution to reduce conflicts in protected area management and it provides the opportunity to take the necessary measures. Lar National Park with an area of 28037 ha is located in 70 km of northeast of Tehran. This area with the aim of protecting 28 species of mammals, 105 species of birds, 23 species of reptiles and several species of fish has been managed; while this region receives a population of nomads every year, who use the pastures of the regions for grazing in a period of one hundred days. To prepare a conservation management plan, the ecological resources of the region were mapped and overlaid to achieve management units. These units were investigated for restricted nature, protected, restoration, recreational and special zones in the area. After determination of social economic conditions of native people, a management plan was defined for the region. The planning defined public participation, staff training, ecological and socio economic impacts assessment and monitoring program in Lar National Park. Findings revealed that Lar National Park has an important role in preserving the nature and species of the region based on the evaluation. Therefore, for the protection and promotion of habitats and species, it has required conscious and active intervention and a coherent management plan for the region should be considered. Conservation of hotspot biodiversity areas ensures that other human activities do not harm these areas, and the reliability and viability of areas with higher conservation values over an indefinite period of time is ensured. The study proved that the zoning process is a decision-making issue that inherently requires the evaluation of different land features based on multiple objectives. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Decision-making; National park; Protected area; Zonning","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108674746"

It is the most important West-East geo-ecological space in China, containing protected areas vital for biodiversity conservation and ecological security of China. The protection and rational development of its natural habitat is of great significance to China’s ecological security and integration of protected areas based on mountain forest ecosystems on a global scale. In this study, five important types of protected areas in the transitional zone were selected, and their spatial patterns were analysed. Spatial analysis methods, such as kernel density estimation and accessibility analysis, were employed for both point and areal data, and focused on four aspects: land use scale, shift in the centre of gravity, spatial agglomeration, and accessibility. In addition, policy background and evolution of spatial and temporal characteristics of the protected area system in the transitional zone from 1963 to 2017 were also examined. We analysed the characteristics and geographical significance of the West-east corridor using the spatial pattern of the protected area system from the perspective of ecological and economic spaces. We focused on spatial shape, type intersection, and key areas to analyse the spatial overlap of the protected areas. Protected area establishment was divided into three stages: initial (1956–1980), rapid development (1981–2013), and national park transformation (2014—present). These stages reflected the change in the concept of ‘simple protection—sustainable use—integration and upgrade’ for protected areas of China. The spatial centre of gravity of the protection zone system was located in the west Qinling-Daba Mountains, and its high-density core exhibited a relatively stable N-shaped structure composed of four gathering areas. Affected by factors such as geographic environment and socio-economic development density, the average access time for protected areas was high (1.56 h); wetland parks and scenic areas are located closer to the city centre. As the West-east corridor in the transitional zone extends from west to east, there is a clear spatial dislocation between the development of protected areas and the intensity of human activities. During development, differentiated goal orientation should be adopted based on the idea of zoning and classified governance. With the advancement of the construction of protected areas, the spatial overlap of protected areas in the transition zone has become more prominent. At present, the spatially overlapped protected areas in the transitional zone remain prominent, with inclusion overlap being the most common, and forest parks exhibiting the highest probability of overlap with other protected areas, we should focus on in the integration process of the corridor-type ecological space based on the mountain forest ecosystem. © 2021, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","accessibility; North-south Transitional Zone (NSTZ); protected area (PA); spatial overlap; spatial-temporal pattern; the West-east corridor","China; Daba Mountains; Qinling Mountains; accessibility; policy approach; protected area; spatial analysis; temporal analysis; transition zone","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096837377"

The Sanjiangyuan National Park lies on the hinterland of the Qinghai⁃ Tibetan Plateau and has been officially established in October 2021. Accurate assessment of the density and stock of soil carbon and nitrogen is a prerequisite for scientific recognition of its ecological function and zoning management. However, such knowledge based on field surveys is currently lacking. Based on 54 field soil samples′ data, combined with ecological variables such as elevation, slope, aspect, mean annual air temperature, mean annual precipitation, and mean annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 2000 to 2018, the boosted regression trees models, one of up⁃to⁃date machine learning logarithms, were employed to explore the spatial pattern and classifications of the topsoil (0—30 cm) organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) density in the Sanjiangyuan National Park. The results showed that the density of SOC and TN were (5.41±3.12) kg/ m2(Mean±SD, the same below) and (0.57±0.27) kg/ m2, respectively, and they spatially correlated very well. The spatial variations in the density of SOC and TN were both predominated by precipitation and NDVI, having accumulatively relative contributions of more than 70%. The density of SOC and TN spatially were related to precipitation and NDVI with saturated S⁃shaped responses. The density of SOC and TN in the Lantsang Park and the Huanghe Park were (9.39±0.89) kg/ m2 and (0.92±0.09) kg/ m2, (8.26±2.33) kg/ m2 and (0.80±0.20) kg/ m2, respectively, which were approximately twice than those of the Yangtze Park. The classifications on the density of SOC and TN have been conducted and the rank order in the Lantsang Park decreased gradually from the centers to the surrounding areas, while they decreased from the north to the south and from the southeast to the northwest in the Huanghe Park and the Yangtze Park, respectively. The stocks of SOC and TN in the Sanjiangyuan National Park were 0.60 Pg and 0. 06 Pg, respectively, of which in the Lantsang Park, the Huanghe Park, and the Yangtze Park were approximately 20%, 20%, and 60%, respectively. The stocks of SOC and TN were mainly concentrated in alpine meadows and alpine steppes, which accounted for about 90% of the total reservoir. The alpine meadows and alpine steppes are thus key carriers of carbon sequestration capacity and should be taken into high priority considerations in the Sanjiangyuan National Park. These results can provide important references for the functional evaluation and zoning management of the Sanjiangyuan National Park. © 2022 Science Press.

In this paper, we tease out of the functional zoning models and methods based on the empirical analysis of the world national parks, and then take the Qianjiangyuan National Park (QNP) as an example, study the functional zoning method based on ecological sensitivity. Results show that, the goal of national park construction in the world is changing from enhancing national cohesion to dis-playing the national image, from the pure natural protection and recreation use to protection of the comprehensive function of natural ecosystem integrity protection, recreation, environmental education, etc. The establishment of QNP is to protect the natural ecosystem of sub-tropical lowland broad-leaved evergreen forest, also to meet the community development and recreational consume of large population in Eastern China. So this paper establishes an evaluation index system based on ecological sensitivity, combining ecosystem services, potential habitats of important species, and development opportunities. Based on the analysis result, the functional zoning of QNP can be divided into strict protection area, ecological conservation area, traditional using area and recreational area. In this way, it can make the functional partition reflect system controls thought in area difference and space layout, and take the corresponding management measures in different functional areas, to promote the sustainable evolution of the natural ecological system in national park. © 2020, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

Functional zones may be designated based on administrative boundaries, natural geographical boundaries, or a manual survey. However, the current delineation practice barely considers the integrity of the local ecosystem or human factors, which results in unreasonable and unclear boundaries. Considering two typical areas with large human interference in Qianjiangyuan National Park pilot as an example, we employed both low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology and on-the-ground field vegetation surveys to evaluate the legitimacy of the already established functional zoning boundaries. The results show that 53,550 m                             2                              and 19,667 m                             2                              of the functional area surrounding Henglingjiao and Gutianshan Visitor Center had been modified, respectively, accounting for 29.75% and 16.39% of the aerial study area. Misclassification of functional zoning may occur due to (1) difficulties in distinguishing between areas with large human disturbances and natural features; and (2) partitioning the natural forests into small sections that do not consider the integrity of the vegetative system, which results in lower levels of protection. This study uses a combination of aerial imagery and ground surveys to provide a reasonable and feasible method for the future identification and refinement of functional boundaries in national parks so as to best protect local ecosystem integrity and to reduce human disturbance factors.                          © 2019, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The reasonablefunctional zoning is conducive to better protect and utilize natural resources, to realize its multi?objective scientificmanagement, and is important for protecting biodiversity and promoting ecological civilization significance. Methods?Inthis study, the important protection level of the natural ecosystem in Potatso National Park was taken as the principalweight, and the effects of agriculture, community, transportation, population and other factors on the protectionobjectives of important ecosystems were weighted. The weight spatial overlap method was used for a spatial analysis, inwhich the functional zoning of the national park was divided, and its rationality was evaluated.?Results? The spatialoverlap method based on the weight of important ecological system protection goals was used to partition the national parkin Shangri-La. While determining the importance of the ecological protection objectives, the impacts and demands of thepark's stakeholders were balanced to achieve the goal of both protection and development. According to the results ofthe zoning, Potatso National Park was divided into two main functional zones; the core protection area accounted for53' 35% and the general control area accounted for 46.65% of the total area. The important ecosystems in the core areaaccounted for a high proportion, high concentration, effective protection, and reasonable zoning results. The Potatso'sfunctional zoning resulted in not only protection of the important sub-alpine dark coniferous forest ecosystem, but also inthe enhancement of the scientific nature and functional zoning operability. Conclusion The research results provide atheoretical basis for the construction, planning, protection and utilization of national parks, and a reference for theapplication of the functional zoning method of nature reserves. © 2021 Nanjing Forestry University.

China proposed the establishment of a national park (NP) system and carried out transformative explorations in 10 pilot NPs, however, it is unclear to what extent the pilot NPs represent China's biodiversity and resolve management issues. To answer this question, we assessed the performance of the pilot NPs by analyzing the representativeness across typical ecosystems, biodiversity priority areas, and ecosystem services, and by analyzing the management effectiveness of reorganizing the existing PAs and improving the management intensity and man-land relationships. We found that China's pilot NPs achieved improved representativeness and management effectiveness through range expansion and optimization, institution streamlining, and cohesive management. Compared with the existing PAs, the area of protected typical ecosystems, biodiversity priority areas, and key areas of ecosystem services in the 10 pilot NPs increased by 59.6%, 59.6%, and 54.1% on average, respectively, with a similar land cost overall. The 10 pilot NPs integrated 142 existing PAs of seven categories. The protected areas expanded by 19.4%, and the area under strict protection increased by 42.1%. Additionally, the pilot NPs effectively reduced human disturbance and improved management effectiveness through necessary relocation and enhanced land management. Moving forward, the boundaries and zoning of the NPs should be further optimized, and efforts should be directed to strengthen the governing capacity building, improve the legislation system, increase the financing investment, and promote the value realization of ecological products. © 2022 The Authors","Biodiversity; Ecosystem Services; Management Effectiveness; National Parks; Protected areas; Representativeness","China; Conservation; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Expansion; Investments; Ecosystem services; Management effectiveness; Management issues; National park systems; National parks; Performance; Protected areas; Range expansion; Range optimization; Representativeness; biodiversity; ecosystem service; legislation; national park; protected area; range expansion; zoning; Biodiversity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142315617"

Since the use of wood resources disturbs ecosystems, overharvesting destroys local ecosystems, resulting in a decline in ecosystem services. Therefore, there is a need to balance the use of wood resources by people with the health of the ecosystem. In this study, we evaluated wood provisioning in newly established national parks in Okinawa Main Island, Japan, for future sustainable management. We clarified the spatial distribution between the forest stand volume obtained from LiDAR data, the logging sites before the national park designation, and national park zoning. We found that the buffer zone contains some forests with high stand volume that continue from the core area. There had not been much logging in recent years, but most logging sites were located in the buffer zone and within 200m from roads. Forests with aged stands and high stand volume are important as buffers to prevent isolation of the core area. Therefore, park managers need to consider not only the legal regulations for each zone but also the continuity with the surrounding natural environment to prevent isolation of the core area. Understanding the spatial distribution of wood resources and park zoning relationships at a fine-scale resolution will be useful for managing buffer zones where there is competition between conservation and resource use. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Annual allowable cut; Ecosystem services; Forested landscape; Park management; Sustainability; Yambaru National Park","Aged; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans; Japan; Trees; Wood; Japan; Okinawa [Ryukyu Islands]; Ryukyu Islands; assessment method; buffer zone; ecosystem health; ecosystem service; food provisioning; forest ecosystem; lidar; logging (timber); national park; protected area; satellite data; spatial distribution; subtropical region; sustainability; sustainable development; tropical forest; wood; Article; conservation biology; controlled study; cultivated land; ecosystem; forest management; forest stand; human; Japan; logging; national park; photography; resource management; sustainable development; tropical rain forest; wood; aged; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; tree","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103035399"

Spruce was found to be more vulnerable to fires than pine. Based on the data on the projective cover of the ground vegetation two zones of pyrogenic exposure were distinguished: The impact zone (plants mortality rate 100%) and the buffer zone (plants mortality rate up to 50%). An undamaged plot was chosen as a control area. Changes in the fraction composition of the forest litter in the pyrogenically transformed areas confirms their heterogeneity, the disturbances and the zoning principles. Fires were also revealed to affect the morphologic structure of soils, their acid-base properties, as well as the content of the mineral constituents and humus. It was shown that pyrogenesis affects the structural and functional organization of the soils’ microbial community. A lower catalase activity in the upper organic layer of the soils, affected by the fires the most, is the evidence of the changed redox conditions of the organics transformation. The microbial biomass carbon content and the CO2 emission were shown to depend on the particular soil properties, as well as the zone of pyrogenic exposure. Pyrogenesis negatively affects the organic matter’s quantity and composition, associated with the changes in the fraction composition of the forest litter, which proves the changes it brings for the microbial communities functioning. Decrease in the destructive processes in the impact zone is defined by low substrate requirements of microorganisms there, as well as by unfavourable edaphic conditions. Formation of the negative carbon balance is possible, which means that the ecosystem losses of CO2 won’t be compensated by the incoming plant residues. The data obtained can be used for conducting the ecological monitoring, as well as in creating the conceptual balance models of CO2 emission in Russia. © 2020, Izdatel'stvo Nauka.

Therefore, connectivity between habitat patches is becoming even more important. China began building national parks with the primary purpose of protecting nationally representative natural ecosystems and maintaining the integrity of their structure, processes and functions. Research is necessary to improve the internal connectivity of national parks and to propose suggestions for existing functional zoning and biological corridors. In this study, Qianjiangyuan National Park was selected as an example park, and landscape fragmentation was evaluated exponentially and simulated visually. The habitat characteristics of protected species in the region, morphological spatial pattern analysis and the delta of the probability of connectivity were used together to identify key habitat patches and their importance levels in the study area. Potential habitat corridors in the region were then obtained using least-cost path analysis and gravity modeling methods based on the distribution of key habitat and the migration costs of target species. The results of this study show that the disturbed landscape of the study area is dominated by tea plantations and drylands, with central roads being an important factor affecting the overall landscape connectivity. In terms of the distribution of key habitat patches, the mountains have a high value. In terms of area, their size is not directly proportional to their importance for maintaining landscape connectivity in the region, but large area patches are generally of higher importance. In terms of distance, key habitats that are closer to each other have a stronger correlation and a greater possibility for species migration. Combined with the functional zoning of Qianjiangyuan National Park, the setting of strictly protected areas and recreational areas is reasonable, and traditional use areas and ecological conservation areas could be appropriately adjusted according to the distribution of key habitats. The important corridor in the middle of the ecological conservation area is crucial for the overall connectivity of the national park, and the connectivity between strict protected areas will depend on successful protection of the ecological conservation area. © 2021 by the authors.

Qianjiangyuan National Park is one of the ten national park pilot sites in China and is divided into four functional zones, the core protection zone, ecological conservation zone, recreation zone and traditional utilization zone. Each zone is assigned a different level of protection and corresponding management measures. This study examined the spatial overlap of existing functional zones in Qianjiangyuan and suitable habitats for its target conservation species, the endangered black muntjac (Muntiacus crinifrons). We constructed distribution models based on 94 occurrence locations obtained from camera-trapping surveys from 2014-2018 using MaxEnt. Fifteen covariates related to altitude, topography, vegetative characteristics and human disturbance were used in the MaxEnt models to predict suitable habitats for the black muntjac. The results showed that the black muntjac tended to inhabit areas with intact forest and low road density. We identified 42.5 km                             2                              of suitable habitat, which accounted for 16.9% of the land in Qianjiangyuan National Park. Of this suitable habitat, 69.3% and 30.4% were located in the core protection zone and ecological conservation zone, respectively, which indicated that the existing zone designations can protect black muntjac habitat appropriately. These results also indicated that the black muntjac may serve as an indicator species of the subtropical primary forests where it lives. Promoting habitat integrity for the black muntjac by restoring habitat, constructing corridors and managing across provinces will be key to strengthening the protection of the black muntjac in the region.                          © 2019, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Existing methods of applying FTIR to quartz-hosted melt inclusions, however, require challenging physical manipulation of the host quartz crystals, which can present a significant limitation. Here, we describe a technique for measuring the H2O and CO2 concentrations of melt inclusions fully enclosed in quartz crystals using transmission FTIR, where melt inclusion thickness is calculated using the host quartz silicate overtones. The greater thickness of quartz crystals permitted by this technique allows an additional assessment of volatile equilibrium by measuring structural OH− within the quartz host itself. To demonstrate the advantages of this technique, we applied it to quartz crystals from the Mesa Falls Tuff, Yellowstone. The majority of melt inclusions consist of transparent or brown glassy melt inclusions and record concentrations of 2.9–3.3 wt% H2O and 181–561 ppm CO2, with precision similar to that obtained by standard double-exposed FTIR. Based on volatile saturation models, such concentrations reflect a largely un-degassed magma body equilibrated at pre-eruptive pressures of 100–150 MPa. These H2O concentrations and equilibrium conditions are supported by independent assessments using mineral–mineral and mineral-melt thermohygrometry and thermodynamic modelling using rhyolite-MELTS. The preservation of pre-eruptive volatile concentrations is further corroborated by measurements of OH− in the quartz hosts. A clear decrease in hydroxyl concentrations from core to rim matches closely the zoning in Al, which, combined with the position of quartz infrared bands, most likely reflects variations in Al-moderated OH− solubility rather than diffusive loss. The outermost 200 µm rims, however, show a sharper decline in OH− and corresponding increase in Li+ which is interpreted to record minor diffusive H+ loss and incorporation of Li+ to maintain charge balance. Our FTIR-based technique is simple, effective, and widely applicable to other quartz-bearing magmatic systems, opening up new possibilities to trace pre- syn- and post-eruptive volatile behaviour. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","FTIR; Melt inclusion; MELTS; Quartz; Volatiles; Yellowstone","United States; Yellowstone National Park; assessment method; concentration (composition); fractional crystallization; FTIR spectroscopy; host rock; melt inclusion; quartz; tuff; volatile substance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062603798"

Qianjiangyuan National Park Pilot (hereinafter referred to as Qianjiangyuan National Park, QNP) was used as a case study to explore the recreation suitability assessment system under constraints of zoning. This paper proposed an evaluation index system that combined the use of Delphi and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods to determine the suitable recreation sites of QNP. Attributes selected to represent recreation suitability in the national park included natural recreation resources, scenic beauty, human recreation resources, recreation use aptitude, ecological environment carrying capacity, and social condition. All obtained data were evaluated and integrally overlapped in the Geographical Information Systems base. Thus, a recreation suitabilitymap was created manually on a scale of I to IV, with I being ""not suitable at all."" Results suggested that recreationsuitability levels in QNP tended to have an olive?like distribution. Based on the results of recreational use suitability assessment and management requirements of zonings in the national park, this study identified six types of recreational use and proposed dominant service functions and management measures for those recreation use areas. The results of this study will provide guidance regarding planning and management in national parks. © 2019 Science Press.

This is not enough to preserve dynamic ecosystems that are very vulnerable to natural factors and almost impossible to restore following damage by anthropogenic factors. In the investigated area there are territories with high potential for conservation, which are characterized by the presence of species from the Red Data Book of Ukraine and International Red Lists, plant communities from the Green Data Book of Ukraine and biotopes of global significance. The proposed ten sites should receive protected status, which will bring the protected area up to the necessary minimum to preserve the rare ecosystems of the park from tourism and economic pressure, which have intensified in recent years. For the period of research in 2014–2018, 14 types of sozophytes were identified and confirmed, two of them are the highly localised species endemic to Dzharylhach Island: Molinia euxina Pobed. and Poacynum russanovii (Pobed.) Mavrodiev, A. Laktionov et Y. Alexeev. The syntaxonomic structure of the sozologically valuable coenoses is represented by two basal communities, two subassociations and 8 associations belonging to 9 alliances, 9 orders and 9 classes.

Apero maritimi-Chrysopogonetum grylli, Stipetum borysthenicae nom. prov., subass. Cladietum marisci, Caricetum extensae nom. prov., BC Molinia euxina [Molinion caeruleae] nom. prov. The proposed sites represent 8 biotopes from Annex I of the Habitat Directive, which imposes obligations for their conservation at the world level. We carried out an analysis of the Ukrainian legislative acts, their correlation with international requirements and the zoning of the NPP “Dzharylhatskyi” in relation to these requirements and recommendations.

The state of Maranhão stands out in Brazil for its water resources. The Watersheds of the Eastern Coast of Maranhão (ECWSM) are located in the Hydrographic Region of the Western Atlantic. The present paper characterizes the physiography of the ECWSM of Maranhão, highlighting the components and natural potential (altimetry, declivity, soils, vegetation, water resources, geology and geomorphology), which were mapped using geotechnologies and secondary data. Thus, this paper provides information for the planning of socioeconomic development programs as well as land management plans. The geology, geomorphology, pedology and vegetation data were obtained from the IBGE database at a scale of 1:250,000. The Digital Elevation Model was obtained from the TOPODATA project. Water resources data were obtained from the IBGE, National Water Agency. The ECWSM analyzed were: the Hydrographic Basin System of the Rivers Itatuaba, Anajatuba, Axuí, Mapari, Periá, Grande and the Hydrographic Basins of the Negro and Preguiças Rivers. The morphological and physical attributes of the ECWSM and the relationships of ecological potential (geology, geomorphology, hydrology and climate), biological exploitation (soil and vegetation) and human actions reveal proxies of the evolution of the Holocene landscape. The natural resources and landscape of Conservation Units within these watersheds form immense nurseries for biological productivity that supports traditional economic activity.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the landscape factors involved in roadkill of the endangered Ryukyu long-furred (Diplothrix legata) rat in Yambaru, the northern Okinawa-jima Island, Japan. We analyzed the relationship between roadkill sites and landscape factors (evergreen broad-leaved forest area, artificial pine forest area, average vegetation height, and minimum radius of road curve) using a generalized linear model, incorporating spatial autocorrelation using Moran’s eigenvector maps along a 13.9 km route using census data from May 2011 to April 2017. In addition, we clarified the relationship between the number of roadkills and national park zoning. Roadkill incidence was found to be positively correlated with average vegetation height and the percentage of pine forest area. The number of roadkill incidents was also higher in zones with higher levels of protection compared to areas with lower or no protection. These results suggest the need for measures in areas containing these landscape elements, such as mature forests and higher percentage of pine forests. © 2021 The Author(s).

How to scientifically classify types and identify spaces is a fundamental task in the layout and construction of national parks, which is critically needed in practice. Based on the national conditions of China and related international experience, we classified national parks into wilderness oriented, ecological priority, recreation oriented, and heritage oriented types, and constructed a relatively complete national park classification scheme. With Yunnan Province as a case, which has a high degree of natural and human diversity, we established a set of index and zoning rules based on “dual evaluation”. The artificial neural networks were used to establish a land use evolution learning algorithm. The meta-cellular automata incorporating an adaptive inertia mechanism was used for spatio-temporal simulation. Spatial identification of different types of national parks was performed for the whole province under high resolution. The contraction-expansion principle was applied to compare, correct, and optimize the identified areas. A comprehensive plan for the future layout of Yunnan National Park was proposed. The results showed that national parks in Yunnan Province were mainly concentrated in the Sanjiang region and the Hengduan Mountains, the west and southwest Yunnan. Those three types of areas could be used as key areas for future national park planning and protection. The general and worth popularizing research paradigm for national park typology and spatial identification established here could be served as a reference for national application. © 2023 Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology.

The scientific assessment of the degree of human disturbance and its impact in the national park and surrounding areas is a basic premise to improve the accuracy of spatial supervision of human activities. Taking Sanjiangyuan National Park as an example, based on the modified model for measuring the degree of human disturbance and the survey ledger database of human disturbance behavior, this paper quantitatively evaluated the temporal and spatial variation process of the degree of human disturbance in the national park and its surroundings from 1980 to 2018, analyzed the driving forces and main factors affecting general disturbance and anomic disturbance, and discussed the main deficiencies in the supervision of human disturbance and suggestions for optimization. The results showed that: (1) the degree of human disturbance in Sanjiangyuan National Park was relatively stable, rising only 3.237% between 1980 and 2018. The degree of human disturbance of the Yangtze River Source Park was significantly lower than that in the Lancang River Source Park and the Yellow River Source Park. (2) The rise in the degree of human disturbance was comparatively notable between 2000 and 2010, but levelled off between 2010 and 2018, indicating that the enforcement of ecological protection measures and laws have become stricter since 2010, and have significantly curbed the growth of human disturbance in the Sanjiangyuan National Park. (3) Infrastructure construction with a focus on transportation, population urbanization, traditional production and living activities of aboriginal people and recreational activities are the main drivers of variation in the degree of human disturbance. (4) The construction of roads and supporting facilities along the routes, aboriginal living facilities, and hydropower facilities are the main causes of anomic human disturbance in the national park. Aiming at the drivers and supervision of human disturbance in the Sanjiangyuan National Park and surrounding areas, it was recommended to implement fine⁃grained zoning controls, to activate and regulate market⁃based management mechanisms, to create net - zero emission green infrastructure, and to ameliorate the hardware and software system for supervising recreational behavior, so as to shape the interaction between ecological protection and utilization in the national park under the premise of zero disturbance. © 2022 Science Press.

The Algerian forest and in particular the Tlemcen forest massif where the national park is located are very affected by the repetition and the danger of fires. We count 1600 fire starts recorded during the period from 1980 to 2015. This situation is influenced by the ecotourism status and the high human accessibility, in the forest area as well as the significant development of road infrastructure in the middle of the forest. Noting also the characteristics of the plant formations and topographical in the area seriously promote the flammability and combustibility of the vegetation. Faced with this problem, it is necessary to protect the Tlemcen forest massif by mapping the risk zoning of forest fires. In order to achieve this objective, we followed an approach inspired by the Turkish model developed by Erten et al. (In: XXth ISPRS congress, youth forum, July 12–23, 2004, Istanbul, Turkey, pp 33–39, 2004) and based on the multi-criteria analysis method AHP with a hierarchical combination of six parameters, ecological, topographic and human on the one hand, and a classification of these parameters according to their sensitivities to fires on the other hand. This uses remote sensing data and GIS tools. The results obtained gave five risk classes (very low, low, medium, high and very high); the high and very high risk occupy 48.27% of the total surface studied. The validation of these results was made by the multitemporal analysis of satellite images dating from 2001 to 2017 and the superimposition of the burnt spaces detected on the fire risk map.

It requires the strictest ecological protection. At the same time, the relationship between the local pastoralists' livelihood and the carrying capacity of resources and environment should be properly handled to form a new model of harmonious development between humans and nature. This study explores the nature proportion (N%), i.e., the minimum conservation area for biodiversity and ecosystem services and the maximum area for local pastoralists' livelihood at the regional scale of the Sanjiangyuan National Park, and seeks approaches and models of sustainable management of the social-ecological system. The theoretical, realized and predicted N% are calculated based on: the diet niche volume and overlap of dominant livestock (Domestic yak and Tibetan sheep) and wild ungulate herbivores (Tibetan antelope, Tibetan gazelle, Wild yak and Tibetan wild ass), the population, density and land use of dominated livestock (116.70 × 104 sheep unit) and wild ungulate herbivores (31.40 × 104 sheep unit), and the livestock population (123.07 × 104 sheep unit) at local (6.43 × 104) pastoralists' basic living needs, by 90%, 30% and 74%, respectively. Furthermore, the realized and predicted N% can be optimized to 67% and 83%, respectively, by spatial coupling and optimizing of resource allocation among regions, and utilizing forage resources produced by the development of the grass industry in the peripheral support area for ""Rest Grazing During Turning Green Period"" and ""Warm Grazing Cold Feeding Two-stage Feeding"" (supplying forage for 190 days, i.e.,an increase of 4.47 × 104 km2 grassland for conservation) or for livestock population (feeding livestock of 60.25 × 104 sheep unit, i.e., an increase of 1.55 × 104 km2 grassland for conservation) at local pastoralists' basic living needs. The N% obtained by different accounting conditions, methods, and purposes is quite different. The accounting of a practical and reasonable N% under multiple targets should consider identifying, prioritizing and zoning of biodiversity conservation areas, key areas of ecological security barriers, the areas offsetting the impact of future climate change, the beneficiary areas of important ecosystem services (such as water resources), suitable areas for local pastoralists' development, and ecosystem services assessment and quantifying of ecosystem services goods. By identifying and comprehensive consideration of all of the above factors affecting the social-ecological system, it is possible to quantify N% for Sanjiangyuan National Park at a scale of ecoregions, so as to realize its sustainable development. © 2019, Science Press.

After conducting the interviews and the observations supported by relevant literature sources, this article shows that the SAD believes that the cosmos is not only inhabited by humans, but there are nonhuman beings such as animals and Badewo who are perceived as a human in which they are believed as social actors in forest conservation. SAD and nonhuman beings live together and contribute to each other and have a mutual relationship to life sustainability in the forest or so-called indigenous religion.

It is comprised of unique land-use systems and agricultural landscapes formed by long-term co-evolution and dynamic adaptation of rural communities and their environment. IAHS sites are rich in biodiversity and support of local socio-economic and cultural development. They also play a positive role in coordinating community livelihoods and ecological protection through their soil and water management strategies, knowledge systems, and cultural connotations. Therefore, it is of great significance to assess the value of IAHS for adaptive IAHS management per se, as well as optimizing the protected area system and its zoning-based management according to human-environment interactions. Our study first reviewed the value systems of related concepts, focusing on natural resource assets, ecosystem functions and services, and various types of natural and cultural heritage to generalize the value typology and assessment methods for heritage systems and their key elements. We then examined the uniqueness of IAHS based on our understanding of the general agricultural heritage systems (AHS) and the more specific Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) to ensure that characteristics such as complexity, vitality, and strategy were fully reflected in the value system. IAHS is comprised of both material and non-material parts. Its' complexity indicates the assimilation of values from natural and cultural heritage, as well as cultural landscapes. Vitality implies the system's dynamics based on its historical and current value as an adaptive system. Strategy defines the positive externality of IAHS towards people beyond its local area, determining its contribution to regional and global sustainable development strategies. Afterwards, the value typology of IAHS was proposed. The value system was firstly divided into existence and potential values to reflect the impact of IAHS on the current and future generation. The existence value was further separated into carrier and service values. The carrier value is the intrinsic value based on the physical formation of agricultural land as an asset stock during its historical period. The service value is the measure of flow from the stock. It is composed of nine values, namely the product value, ecological value, sci-tech value, social value, aesthetic value, cultural value, historical value, spiritual value, and brand value, and is further divided to 25 value elements at the lowest level. We also proposed possible evaluation methods and statistical approaches targeting at potential indicators of the existence value to obtain the monetary value of certain IAHS to better implement this multi-layered value system in policy making and conservation management. Key methods were selected from practices that evaluated ecosystem services, farmland, and natural resources, including the direct marketing method, substitutable marketing method, and simulated market method. Non-material value elements, which usually were only valued quantitatively, were discussed to determine the difficulty and possibility of quantitative accounting. As a result, the value typology can help managers identify IAHS conservation focal points according to the value connotation. The existence value must be well preserved. The potential value should be further studied. The conservation of the carrier value is mainly dependent on local farmland protection. Some service values benefiting large areas are better protected via regional cooperation. As a result, this research revealed the values embedded in human-environment interactions in the IAHS and interpreted their importance in maintaining a harmony between human and environment; thus providing a theoretical basis for spatial integration and management optimization of protected areas, as well as coordinative decision-making for regional conservation and development. It also provided a whole set of value systems and evaluation methods for the monetary value of IAHS; synthesized from quantitative or qualitative methods used in ecosystem services, natural resources assets, natural and cultural heritages, and brands. © 2020, Science Press.

We propose to utilise character-based approach for managing landscape change and preserving its integrity. This paper presents a hierarchical characterisation method for the M-GW landscape in Ji-Town in two steps: definition and delimitation of landscape area, and zoning of landscape characters. The landscape area was identified based on the landscape relevance of the space from natural, cultural, and visual aspects. The landscape character types and areas were identified by two dominant attributes using a layout method at Level I (general zoning), and by eight specific attributes using a synthetic method that combines digital and manual approaches at Level II (detailed zoning). According to the analysis results, a wide belt landscape area of about 8650.7 km2 was delimited. A total of eight landscape character types, 15 sub-types, 47 landscape character areas and 359 sub-areas were obtained. Additionally, the results highlighted the key landscape characteristics that could be used for the planning and construction of the National Cultural Park.

Based on the research background of different geomorphological zoning, we selected the MODIS NDVI data from 2000 to 2020 to analyze the NDVI trends using a univariate linear model. A partial correlation analysis and multiple correlation analysis were used to reveal the influence of temperature and precipitation on NDVI trends. Fourteen factors related to meteorological factors, topographic factors, geological activities, and human activities were selected, and the Geographically Weighted Regression model was used to study the mechanisms driving NDVI change. The results were as follows: (1) The NDVI value of Giant Panda National Park has fluctuated and increased in the past 21 years, with an annual growth rate of 4.7%/yr. Affected by the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, the NDVI value fluctuated greatly from 2008 to 2012, and reached its peak in 2018. (2) The NDVI in 94% of the study area improved, and the most significant improvement areas were mainly distributed in the northern and southern regions of Southwest Subalpine and Middle Mountain and the Xiaoxiangling area. Affected by the distribution of fault zones and their local activities, vegetation degradation was concentrated in the Dujiangyan–Anzhou area of Hengduan Mountain Alpine Canyon. (3) The Geographically Weighted Regression analysis showed that natural factors were dominant, with climate and elevation having a double-factor enhancement effect, the peak acceleration of ground motion and fault zone having a superimposed effect, and river density and slope having a double effect, all of which had a significant impact on the NDVI value of the surrounding area. To optimize the ecological security pattern of the Giant Panda National Park, we recommended strengthening the construction of ecological security projects through monitoring meteorological changes, preventing, and controlling geo-hazards, and optimizing the layout and intensity of human activities. © 2022 by the authors.

Taking the Beijing Great Wall National Park System Pilot Area as an example, this paper selects the indicators from the three aspects of ""ecological background"", ""resource characteristics"" and ""human interference"" to construct an index system for natural resources protection zoning. Using subcompartment as a zoning unit, the national park is divided into seven natural resource protection areas at first according to the ecological background characteristics, which are used as the basic units for resource survey and management of national parks. Then the national park are further subdivided into 17 kinds of natural resource protection areas according to the specific resource problems and protection demands, forming a two-level natural resource protection zoning scheme. Furthermore, corresponding protection measures are proposed based on the protection objectives of each protected area. The zoning scheme avoids the difficulty of coordination caused by the overlapping or misplaced space layout of various types of land in the national park. Moreover, it is also conducive to the implementation of natural resource protection zoning scheme and the effective protection of natural resources in the national park. © 2019 Science Press.

At present, China is making every effort to build a nature-protection system, with national parks as the main body, and this approach considers China′s urgent goals of obtaining carbon neutrality and mitigating climate change. It is of great significance to the national carbon-neutralization strategy to accurately predict the carbon sink capacity of national park ecosystems under the background of global change. To evaluate and predict the dynamics of the carbon sink capacity of national parks under climate change and different management measures, we combined remote-sensing observations, model simulations and scenario analyses to simulate the change in the carbon sink capacity of the proposed Kunlun Mountain National Park ecosystem over the past two decades (2000–2020) and the change in the carbon sink capacity under different zoning controls and various climate change scenarios from 2020 to 2060. Our results show that the carbon sink capacity of the proposed Kunlun Mountain National Park area is increasing. Simultaneously, the carbon sink capacity will be improved with the implementation of park management and control measures; which will be increased by 2.04% to 2.13% by 2060 in the research area under multiple climate change scenarios. The research results provide a scientific basis for the establishment and final boundary determination of the proposed Kunlun Mountain National Park. © 2022 by the authors.","climate change; CMIP6; management schemes; nature protected area","Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Parks, Recreational; China; Kunlun Mountains; carbon; carbon sink; climate change; CMIP; environmental protection; national park; nature reserve; park management; remote sensing; article; carbon sink; climate change; ecosystem; mountain; national park; remote sensing; simulation; carbon sequestration; ecosystem; environmental protection; procedures; recreational park","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136686420"

Behind this most popular concept of nature in the world, there are many problems of land use in it. Sukarame Village is one example of a village where most of the village area is in the Halimun Salak National Park area. There are various reasons people can live and carry out economic and socio-cultural activities in the Halimun Salak National Park area. One of the economic activities was PETI (unlicensed gold mining), which can show there is an economic activity to the tertiary level. For indigenous people, this modernization can continue without removing various native cultures and values. This study aims to analyze the indigenous people activities and land-use in the national park rules. Data collection in this study used field surveys and in-depth interviews with village officials and local communities. The analyze are used qualitative descriptive. The results of the study show that people's activities and development can continue, although the people of Sukarame Village are living in the national park area with limited access to several villages. Historical and natural resources are the reason factor for people to survive and settle. Then, there are some agreements with local government, so the indigenous people can continue their activities and accept the modernization. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Economics; Forestry; Land use; Laws and legislation; Data collection; Economic activities; In-depth interviews; Indigenous people; Local government; Natural conservation; Population activities; Tertiary levels; Rural areas","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079017330"

It is an important eco-safety barrier in China and even Asia, and a priority of China’s to promote ecological advancement. Precisely assessing the dynamics and mechanisms of alpine grassland ecosystem carbon budgets is beneficial for quantifying the response to climate change on a regional scale. The spatial distribution and dynamic changes in carbon fluxes in the TRSR from 1985 to 2018 were analyzed by the Theil–Sen + Mann–Kendall and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) methods, and multiple linear regression was used to quantify the contribution of meteorological elements to the carbon flux trends. The results indicated that (1) the alpine grassland ecosystem was a weak carbon sink. The multiyear mean gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem production (NEP) in the TRSR were 147.86 and 11.27 g C/m2/yr, respectively. The distribution of carbon fluxes progressively decreased from east to west. (2) The carbon fluxes of the alpine grassland ecosystem were dominated by a monotonically increasing trend, with increasing rates of GPP and NEP of 1.31 and 0.40 g C/m2/yr, respectively. A total of 48.60% of the alpine grassland showed a significant increase in NEP, whereas only 0.21% showed a significant decrease during the research term. (3) The alpine meadow sequestered carbon better than the alpine steppe did and accounted for more than 60% of the regional carbon sink. (4) In a correlation analysis between NEP and temperature, precipitation and solar radiation, the positive correlation accounted for 89.67%, 90.51%, and 21.16% of the TRSR, respectively. Rising temperatures and increased precipitation were the main drivers contributing to the increase in NEP. Research on carbon budget variability and mechanisms can help guide preservation zoning initiatives in national parks. © 2022 by the authors.","alpine grassland; EEMD; net ecosystem productivity; three rivers source region","Budget control; Carbon; Climate change; Ecosystems; Linear regression; Rivers; Alpine grasslands; Carbon fluxes; Carbon sink; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Grassland ecosystems; Net ecosystem production; Net ecosystem productivities; Source region; Three river source region; Empirical mode decomposition","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140035174"

Evaluation of the integrity and authenticity of national parks is a prerequisite for studies such as layout planning, boundary range determination, and functional zoning of national parks. To assess the integrity and authenticity status of natural ecosystems in national parks, this study provided a method in which data are easily accessible, assessment methods are simpler, and assessment results are clearly understood by decision-makers, managers, and the public. Methods: Based on the structure and function of terrestrial natural ecosystems, this study constructed an evaluation index system of terrestrial natural ecosystem integrity and authenticity and its quantitative evaluation method through index screening, expert consultation, index quantification, and the establishment of a comprehensive evaluation model. The evaluation method contained five indicators of natural ecosystem integrity, five indicators of natural ecosystem authenticity, and two comprehensive evaluation indicators. Taking Qianjiangyuan National Park system pilot in Zhejiang Province as an example, this study initially assessed its ecosystem integrity and authenticity status, and graded the assessment results. Results: According to the assessment method of this study, the evaluation result of natural ecosystem integrity of Qianjiangyuan National Park system pilot was 52.83%, with a less good evaluation grade; while the evaluation result of natural ecosystem authenticity was 87.06%, with a good evaluation grade. The indicators that deserve attention and improvement in Qianjiangyuan National Park system pilot include the integrity index of the conservation area (27.00%) and the integrity index of the flagship species suitable habitat (53.04%). Conclusion: This study constructed an evaluation method for the integrity and authenticity of terrestrial natural ecosystems in national parks with comprehensive evaluation index coverage, easy data acquisition, and easy evaluation results to be understood by decision makers and managers. © 2021, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Functional zoning, the most relevant process in protected area planning and management, is an integral part of the optimization of the system. Natural parks, an important part of these protected areas, also have many problems with functional zoning; for example, the inadequate coordination between the development of both the ecology and economy and the lack of studies for a comprehensive planning have not led to a sustainable development of these protected areas. Therefore, to solve these zoning issues, this study proposes a comprehensive functional zoning method for natural parks, applying it to the Huangshan Scenic Area as an example. The method is based on the assessment of irreplaceability, ecological vulnerability, condition of landscape resources, and ecological suitability. From a functional perspective, natural parks can be first divided into protected ecological, protected landscape, and developmental zones. Both the protected ecological and landscape zones can be further subdivided into core and important zones. In addition, the developmental zone can be further subdivided into recreational, agricultural, and living zones. © 2019 Science Press.

To define the most relevant trails for this study, the following criteria were used: visitation demand, impact intensity, and zoning. The elevation profile and other physical attributes of the selected trails were obtained by GPS. Erosion was established as the predominant impact, and the length of eroded stretches on each trail was evaluated. The trail to Pico da Bandeira through Casa Queimada has a greater declivity, and, although it sees fewer visitors than the trail to Pico da Bandeira through Tronqueira, it shows a higher erosion rate. This result indicates that, in certain cases, the declivity can contribute more significantly to the increase in erosion than the number of visitors. © 2019 Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.","Erosion; Pico da Bandeira; Protected areas; Public use","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073223044"

Findings revealed that in the next 50 years, the increasing human settlement and associated social-economic needs will erase any remnant wildlife hotspots in the ‘Unrestricted zone’ of the district and reclaim intrusion in its ‘Restricted zone’ of which ANP is part. This raises imminent fear of growing cases of encroachment of human activities into illegal and high-risk zones and a possible second de-gazettement of the park. The reversal of this trend requires the implementation of the local LULC plan and the promotion of the ecological lifestyle. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.","Biodiversity; conservation; demography; Gatsibo district; natural heritage; urbanization","Biodiversity; Conservation; Data; Land Use; Rwanda; Settlement; Statistics; Systems; Akagera National Park; East Province; Rwanda; Biodiversity; Demography; Global positioning system; Information management; Land use; Parks; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Zoning; Demographic dynamics; Environmental planning; Gatsibo district; High population density; Land-use land-cover changes; National parks; Natural heritages; Protected areas; Sub-saharan africa; Urbanization; biodiversity; demography; environmental policy; future prospect; land use change; population density; prediction; protected area; urbanization; Conservation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110889234"

The conventional strategy has been to design protected areas based on flagship species; however, this has often proven ineffective for protecting other sympatric wildlife. Here, using China's Giant Panda National Park (GPNP) as an example, we evaluated the effectiveness of integrating multiple conservation parameters for flagship and sympatric endangered species to optimize zoning designations, without compromising or jeopardizing the primary goal of protecting giant pandas. We conducted a stepwise spatial prioritization according to taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity for 48 endangered bird and 23 mammal species. Conservation priority areas for each taxon were spatially congruent across diversity indices but differed between taxa. Species richness provided only a weak indicator of conservation values. The current designation scheme for giant panda protection performs moderately well in terms of sheltering sympatric endangered birds and mammals, but there is still scope for improvement. After balancing competing land uses, we identified 7731 km2 with the highest conservation values across taxa and diversity indices, with 26 % of this optimal priority area lying outside of current core protection zones of the GPNP. We recommend that GPNP's current zoning designation criteria are modified to conserve a broader range of species alongside giant pandas, especially to better protect sites from human disturbance. Our findings also have the broader potential to inform conservation planning for protected areas worldwide, enabling the protection of flagship species to be integrated with broader regional biodiversity conservation. © 2023 The Authors","Alternative land use; Conservation priority area; Endangered species; Giant Panda National Park; Species richness; Zoning designation","China; biodiversity; conservation planning; endangered species; land use; national park; optimization; prioritization; species richness; zoning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151428467"

Exploring ways to reconcile and eliminate conflict patches between ecological protection and community development in national parks is important for many developing countries in further promoting the target 12 of sustainable consumption and production in SDGs(ONUs' Sustainable Development Goals).We innovatively propose a combination method for optimising the functional zoning of national parks, taking the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon national park (YZGCNP) as an example, under a new perspective of reconciling conflicts between national parks and human activities. Following are the major findings: (1) Based on the overlay analysis of habitat quality and human activity intensity, the conflict patches can be identified, and then can be classified into five different levels from 1 to 5 by using the difference matrix, based on the objective of ecological protection and conflict coordination. (2) The trends of a control scenario (eliminating patch conflicts) and no-control scenario (uncontrolled development) were projected to 2035 according to the management objectives of the different zones. Comparing the two scenarios, it was found that the area of patches with the most significant conflicts was reduced by 1102 km2 in the control scenario, and the area of patches with the highest habitat quality and lowest human activity increased by 852 km2. (3) An analysis of the effectiveness of the InVEST-HFI-CaMarkov model combination concluded that the link between models is rational and can successfully identify and eliminate the conflicts between ecological protection and human activities in national parks. This study provides a new perspective and an applied paradigm for the combination of methods for functional zoning of national parks, which can serve as a reference for their sustainable development. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Conflict identification; Habitat quality; Human activities; National parks; Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon national park (YZGCNP)","China; Xizang; conflict management; ecological approach; habitat quality; human development index; national park; optimization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149944512"

Obtaining information on spatio-temporal occurrence patterns of cetaceans can be especially challenging. This study used platforms of opportunity (i.e., fishing monitoring vessels) from May 2004 to May 2012 as a cost-effective way to address this knowledge gap in the Wakatobi National Park (WNP) at the heart of Coral Triangle, an important area for cetaceans in Indonesia. A database was created of cetacean sightings per surveyed days at sea, allowing for an analysis of species diversity and habitat use around the islands. Of the 11 cetacean species identified, spinner and bottlenose dolphins were sighted most often, followed by melon-headed and sperm whales. Spinner dolphin showed a wide distribution in the area, whilst bottlenose dolphin and melon-headed whale occupied the waters between the main islands and south atolls. Sperm whales occurred mostly in waters north of the main islands and as melon-headed whales, mostly in deep waters. Most cetacean sightings occurred in the zones designated for human use, indicating where potential conflicts might occur. No sightings were found in the Park core zone, suggesting a mismatch between WNP design and the cetacean ecological needs. Based on a sub-sample of the dedicated fishing monitoring sightings a sighting frequency was derived. Small and large cetaceans were reported mostly during inter-monsoonal seasons, possibly related to increased prey availability due to seasonal upwelling and increased survey activity. Inter-annual occurrence of cetaceans was variable, with no large cetaceans being sighted in 2010–2012, likely due to reduced survey efforts. In areas with limited resources for designated surveys, the use of platforms of opportunity can be a cost-effective tool to provide valuable data on cetacean occurrence. While data collection protocols in the WNP can be improved further, the results presented here already help identify potentially important areas as well as highlight where to direct designated research efforts.

This resulted in the complication of management activities in the Central Ecological Zone. The Law on Lake Baikal protection, by-laws, statements and orders prescribe numerous limitations and do not promote the sustainable development of the Baikal Natural Territory. The idea of UNESCO geoparks is oriented essentially to the sustainable development of territories, comprising unique sites. The main task of land use planning in the central ecological zone of Lake Baikal is to keep Lake Baikal as a natural World Heritage Site and a strategic drinking water resource, taking into account the interests of the population living there. Institute of Geography of SB RAS performed landscape planning of Olkhon District with the establishment of development sites, but these plans are still not realized. This causes conflicts between Pribaikalsky National Park and the local population. A successful development of Basic Sites of Baikal Geopark on the territory of Olkhon District is aimed to solve numerous local problems oriented to the results of landscape planning. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Ecology; Environmental protection; Land use; Planning; Potable water; Sustainable development; Zoning; Ecological zones; Heritage sites; Land Use Planning; Landscape planning; Local populations; Local problems; Management activities; National parks; Lakes","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077456425"

The primary drivers of this degradation are multiple and are highly linked to anthropogenic influences, including over-exploitation and poor management of marine resources. The effectiveness of management actions in marine protected areas (MPAs) has often been hampered by a lack of data to inform management recommendations. This was emphasized by The Nature Conservancy’s (TNC) Coral Reef Report Card which highlighted not only the lack of data collection in Antigua and Barbuda and other Caribbean nations, but also illustrated how spatially dispersed available datasets are. The government of Antigua and Barbuda recognized the need for a marine data collection program to better inform the designation and management of MPAs as a tool to improve the health of the marine ecosystems. The Atlantic Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) protocol has been identified as a means to address planning and management for marine areas. Three AGRRA surveys have been conducted in the years following the TNC 2016 report, in previously established managed areas: North East Marine Management Area (NEMMA) in 2017 and Nelson Dockyard National Park (NDNP) in 2019 as well as areas outlined for future management (Redonda in 2018). Our surveys were conducted to provide updated datasets to inform management for the aforementioned areas. While the results of these surveys mirror the underlying poor coral reef-health conditions, which have been shown to exist within the Caribbean region, they also highlight intra-site variation that exists within each survey location. This knowledge can be crucial in guiding management decisions in these marine areas, through zoning and other management prescriptions. Additionally, the marine surveys conducted around Redonda established useful marine baselines to aid in monitoring the island’s recovery following removal of terrestrial invasive species. This article provides an overview of data collected using the AGRRA methodology in marine zones across Antigua and Barbuda which have current or future management prescriptions and provides recommendations to demonstrate the data’s future utilization for marine conservation and management.

Urban parks play a key role in conserving biodiversity. Despite the advantages of complex vegetation structures for insect and bird diversity, a simple vegetation structure is favored in urban parks worldwide. The trade-off between human recreation and biodiversity conservation is challenging. Zoning strategy may be an effective countermeasure informed by the national park and natural scenic area; a zoning-based solution was introduced in this study, including preserved core zones and surrounding recreation zones. Guangyanggu Urban Forest Park was found to be advantageous for biodiversity and in terms of the feasibility of a small hierarchical forest patch (HFP) in the center of Beijing, which can serve as a model for core zones. The park had higher species richness of plants, insects, and birds than did six control sample parks. The Gleason richness indices of insect and bird species significantly correlated with the ratio of multilayered vegetation area to total sample area (r = 0.757 and 0.867 respectively; p < 0.05). The HFP mosaic model was used to develop the core zone in the urban park. Nine scenarios were defined for the HFP mosaic pattern, quantitatively delineating the typical spatial patterns of HFPs in parks. These results will improve the design and management of the current urban park paradigm. A bio-friendly park model characterized by HFP can optimize professional designing and maintenance guidelines for future urban parks. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Bio-friendly park; Biodiversity; Core zone; Forest park; Vegetation structure; Zoning based solution","Beijing [China]; China; Hexapoda; biodiversity; bird; conservation status; national park; species richness; urban ecosystem; vegetation structure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115935081"

In this paper, we present the areas of aptitude for achieving the goals of the Furna Feia National Park and its Buffer Zone, through multi-criteria decision analysis. We collected, processed, and spatialized the data in a Geographic Information System. We defined five goals for the creation of the Furna Feia National Park: (i) preservation of the speleological complex, (ii) biodiversity, (iii) scientific development, (iv) education and tourism, and (v) socioeconomic development, and we selected two criteria general and five specific criteria for each goal. For the multi-criteria decision analysis, all identified criteria were mapped and organized and later weighted using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. We build the suitability maps through weighted linear combinations using map algebra techniques. We spatialized and characterized 15 criteria and 25 sub-criteria, which resulted in five suitability maps. Individually, each of the suitability maps provided territorial indicators for achieving the five goals of the Furna Feia National Park. From the aptitude data generated, it is possible to visualize the strengths and weaknesses in the territory. The multi-criteria decision analysis integrated into the Geographic Information System was promising for the determination of strategic areas to reach the goals, facilitating the decision-making process. © 2022, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

Therefore, carrying out assessments of land and identifying a suitable zone for human habitats were very important. This research creates the territorial suitability assessment and function zoning conceptual model in the earthquake-stricken area, and the new methods of the territorial suitability evaluation system were used to divide the spatial functional zones of the earthquake stricken area, which provide a theoretical guidance and decision-making basis for the reconstruction of the disaster area. The results showed that: (1) The Jiuzhaigou earthquake-stricken area comprises of an ecological area that has a high level of importance to the ecosystem. In the earthquake-stricken area, 65% of national land is at an altitude of 3000–4000 m, and therefore not suitable for a high level of intensive reconstruction, but reconstructed in an eco-friendly manner. (2) The zone suitable for reconstruction comprises mainly of the river valley and the flat terrain of western parts. The land with low suitability is mainly located on steep terrain, such as high mountains and low gullies. The geographic and geomorphic conditions limit the spread of a suitable reconstruction zone. (3) The earthquake-stricken area mainly comprises of a tourism industry gathering area, population gathering area, agriculture and animal husbandry development area, and ecological preservation area with areas of 76 km                             2                             , 44 km                             2                             , 1591 km                             2                              and 7512 km                             2                             , respectively.

Contained within conservation forests are the 54 national parks, of which nine are predominantly marine, six are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and five are Ramsar wetland sites. This chapter investigates Indonesia’s mountainous national parks, which accounts for around 9% of the archipelago’s landmass. The first batch of five national parks was designated in 1980, and the number increased gradually, reaching 41 by 2003. The current crop of 54 national parks are defined as conservation areas that possess native ecosystems managed via zoning to facilitate research, education, biodiversity and tourism goals. Efforts have been made to fade out the ‘fences and fines’ approach in favour of a more participatory approach to PA management. However, ineffective conservation is revealed by the influx of tourists at popular destinations such as Mount Bromo (2,329 m), an active volcano in the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. Unregulated nature-based tourism at Bromo and other mountainous national parks has negative environmental impacts such as air and water pollution, effects on wildlife behaviour, habitat deterioration, solid waste accumulation, erosion of the rim of the volcano, vandalism, and illegal flora harvesting. Management tools such as cost recovery mechanisms and climber permits are investigated as potential counter-strategies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Collaborative management; Governance; Indonesia; Mount Bromo; National parks","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126724615"

We assessed whether multi-use zoning of the Giant Panda National Park (GPNP) could achieve the goal of protecting the panda population and its habitat, while also promoting community development. We integrate panda presence data, human disturbance distribution, and environmental factors to evaluate panda habitat suitability, the effectiveness of zoning designations, and the impact of human disturbance on panda habitat. Our results show that panda habitat suitability has been partially improved, as certain areas of increased in suitability or stabilized (maintained suitability) across the research region between 2001–2003 and 2011–2013, based on the 3rd and 4th national surveys of the giant panda. Most of the optimum and suitable habitat for panda were located in the core protection area of the GPNP. However, the optimum habitat in the general control area is often located at the junction with the core protection area, indicating a particular need to strengthen management in these areas. Meanwhile, the encounter rates of livestock grazing were highest in optimum habitat and unsuitable habitat. As such, particular attention needs to be paid to the pressures on wildlife caused by human disturbances, such as livestock grazing, in the general control area. Our analyses and these findings have important implications for giant panda conservation and GPNP construction. © 2021 The Authors","Conservation; Development; Giant panda; Giant panda National Park; Mixed-use; Zoning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104058291"

Following a change in federal government, the system underwent two major revisions: an independent review released in 2015, and a final plan designed by the Director of National Parks implemented in 2018. We used all three iterations of the NRSMPA, from 2012 to 2018, to compare: 1. the MPA zoning composition, using IUCN protected area categories; 2. the achievement of goals for representing biophysical features; and 3. the potential to mitigate threats to biodiversity from commercial fishing and offshore petroleum extraction. We found that protection levels in the NRSMPA were downgraded in 2018, compared to 2012 and 2015 iterations. Although each iteration met its qualitative goals, the lack of quantitative goals meant that representation of biophysical features was highly uneven and dominated by MPAs offering little protection against the impacts of extractive uses. Moreover, existing areas with value for pelagic longlining, demersal trawling, and offshore petroleum extraction were largely avoided by MPAs, irrespective of their biophysical features. MPAs, especially those with high protection, resulted in little forgone fisheries catch and revenue, likely providing few safeguards for species threatened by fishing. Changes in the NRSMPA over time have left more areas open to fishing, particularly pelagic fishing and notably in the Coral Sea. By focusing on meeting poorly defined representation goals instead of threat reduction, changes to the NRSMPA over time have increased the exposure of Australia's marine biodiversity to known threats. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Fishing; Marine protected areas; Petroleum; Representation; Threats","Australia; Coral Sea; Pacific Ocean; biodiversity; commercial species; Commonwealth of Nations; demersal fishery; federal system; fishing; government; longlining; marine ecosystem; national park; offshore application; pelagic fishery; policy implementation; protected area; Red List","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095950505"

Field sampling included vegetation records, small-scale vegetation zoning, the seed bank and water and soil quality. The same main plant species were found in both dry and wet conditions across the riverbed of the outflow channel. We found only very few diaspores of plants in the soil after prolonged drought. In the subsequent flooded state, we examined very dense vegetation on the water surface, which was dominated by the gramineous species Paspalidium obtusifolium. This species formed a compact floating mat that was rooted to the riverbed. The Cyperaceae Bolboschoenus glaucus showed high clonal growth in the form of root tubers, which likely serve as important food reservoir during drought.

By overlaying the zoning layer and land-use conflict layer, it identifies categories of community in the QNP and proposes management measures. The results show that: 1 ) the amount of three types of land-use suitability is abundant with spatial difference. The ecological conservation suitability is high in the middle of QNP but low in the northern and southern part. However, both recreation use and agricultural production suitability are high in the middle and northern part of QNP but low in the south; 2) Using the land-use conflict identification matrix, land-use conflict zone in QNP can be divided into 4 types, including priority land use area, high conflict area, medium conflict area, and low conflict area. 47.24% of land use in QNP has potential conflict, most of which are high conflict. Besides, 50.21% are priority land use area; 3 ) Through overlay analysis of zoning layer and the result of land use conflict, 5 types of communities in QNP are identified, namely relocated community, control developmental community, prioritized governance community, recreation developmental community, and featured agriculture community.

The Conference was held September 26–30, 2022 in St. Petersburg (Proceedings…, 2022). 123 geobotanists from 25 cities of Russia participated in the Conference as well as our colleagues from Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Vietnam. The conference activity was held in three main topics: “Vegetation diversity and conservation”, “Structure and dynamics of plant communities”, “Vegetation geography and cartography”. At the plenary session and section meetings 62 oral and 56 poster presentations were presented. Three “roundtable” talk sessions were held: two of them were dedicated to the problems of vegetation classification and the last — to the issues of geobotanical terminology. A significant part of the reports at the section “Diversity and protection of plant communities” was devoted to the classification of vegetation. The most part of authors used methods of floristic classification (BrownBlanquet approach), but general analytic surveys were presented only in some works, and the rest were devoted to regional and local prodromuses of individual unions or to descriptions of lower syntaxa. A significant part of geobotanists follows the traditional principles of the Russian and Soviet school of dominantdeterminant classification; the two other approaches to vegetation classification were applied in single reports: topologicalecological and geographicalgenetic. Several papers have been devoted to the classification of habitat types. A significant part of vegetation studies have been carried out on the territory of protected areas: nature reserves, sanctuaries, national parks and natural landmarks: from the westernmost — Belovezhskaya Pushcha (Belarus) to the easternmost — the Bastak Reserve (Jewish Autonomous Region) and the Koryak Reserve (Kamchatka Region). Many of the reports at the section “Structure and dynamics of plant communities” concerned the study of vegetation dynamics after anthropogenic impacts, which are the main destabilizing factors of vegetation cover. Very few studies related to climate change have been presented. Several reports analyzed the demographic structure of populations. Few reports were also devoted to the statistical modelling of vegetation dynamics. The modern approach based on the functional characteristics of plants is just beginning to develop in Russian geobotany. Rapidly developing machine learning methods are gradually being introduced into the arsenal of geobotanical science methods — for the purposes of vegetation classification and vegetation mapping. Research in the botanical geography and cartography continues in various regions of our country, in Belarus and Kazakhstan. The positive aspects in cartographic work are the increasing use of remote sensing data and tools for their processing, as well as the compilation of applied maps based on vegetation maps to solve various practical problems. However, a small number of reports were presented in the section “Vegetation geography and cartography”, which may reflect a decrease in interest in this area and a lack of specialists. In addition, it should be noted that very few works devoted to major botanicalgeographic generalizations have been carried out in recent decades. Less and less geobotanists are engaged in middle and smallscale vegetation mapping, which would continue and develop the traditions of the national school of geobotanical mapping and zoning. © 2022 Russian Academy of Sciences, V.L.

It was found that exceedance of the recreational load on the island’s natural complexes leads to their degradation. This dictates the need to develop scientifically based recommendations for managing recreational impacts on natural landscapes. A map of the landscape structure of the study area has been compiled. As a result, seven zones were identified, which combine ten types of natural landscapes of Olkhon Island. Types of recreational activities were recommended for each ecological and tourist zone. The ecological and tourist zones were categorized into three groups according to the level of environmental restrictions. The most stringent environmental restrictions are specific to the first group of ecological and tourist zones, which include an area of relict spruce forest on Mount Zhima and the landscapes of high fault-line slopes of the eastern coast of Olkhon. Limited educational tourism is recommended for the first group. Strict environmental limitations are foreseen for three ecological and tourist zones of the second group represented by the landscapes of the northern part of the island, the coast of the Maloe More and of the transition zone between forest and steppe. The recreational resources of these ecological and tourist zones allow for development of various types of tourism. The coast of Maloe More of Olkhon is characterized by the greatest economic and recreational development. Therefore, rational tourism management is the most acute problem there. General, less strict, environmental restrictions are recommended for the ecological and tourist zones of the third group. The landscapes of these zones are most characteristic for the island and occupy vast areas. They include mountain light coniferous forests and steppes typical for Olkhon and Priolkhonie. For the ecological and tourist zones of the third group, it is appropriate to develop active types of tourism. The ecological and tourist zoning of Olkhon Island is treated as a powerful tool of managing recreational impacts on landscapes that permits the issues related to rational use and protection of natural resources to be addressed in a coherent manner in the process of tourism development. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","anthropogenic disturbance; ecological and tourist zoning; landscape structure; recreational activity; sustainable tourism","Irkutsk [Russian Federation]; Olkhon Island; Russian Federation; coniferous forest; landscape planning; landscape structure; national park; recreational development; tourism development; tourism management; transition zone","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121743176"

Under the background of construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau national park cluster, studying the environmental stress intensity and spatial effects of human productional and living activities is the scientific foundation for the precise implementation of environmental management and control and for the standardization of protection and utilization. This is of great significance for enhancing the sustainable development capacity of the Qinghaia-Tibet Plateau. Taking Sanjiangvuan region as an example, based on the calculation of 4 types of anthropogenic pollutant emissions, i.e. COD, ammonia nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, this paper quantitatively evaluates the county environmental stress intensity of human activities and analyzes its pointa-linea-plane spatial effects in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau national park cluster. As is shown in the results: The emission of anthropogenic pollutants has a low degree of environmental stress to the Sanjiangyuan region, hut shows significantly spatial differentiation characteristics. The central cities (towns) have high stress intensity and the four counties of Maduo, Zaduo, Zhiduo and Qumalai where the national park is located have only 1/2 the average stress intensity. From 2012 to 2016, the regional pattern of spatial effects shows a complex of points, lines, and planes. Points indicate the effects of urbanization and industrialization; lines indicate tourism and transportation; and planes indicate agricultural and animal husbandry production. It is suggested developing managing and responding measures to alleviate the environmental stress in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau national park cluster from the aspects of improvement of the carrying capacity of alla-factor environmental facilities, establishment of a fulla-covering functional zoning control system, and implementation of whole-process environmental regulations for productional, living and touristic activities. © 2021 Science Press.

We estimate that 10% of the suitable habitat for this species had already been lost to quarrying by 2020, and the extension of already proposed concessions could increase this to one-quarter, with the total area impacted by proposed future quarrying as great as 273 km2, or one and a half times greater than the entire area thought to support the species, within a few years. Only 2.66 km2 (1.4% of the species' range) has received formal habitat protection as national park.

It was established to restore and conserve a damaged composite wetland ecosystem comprising urban rivers, inner lakes, and semi-natural forests with fruit trees in central Guangzhou. In 2013, our survey at HNWP revealed that the bird diversity was poor, which indirectly reflected the low habitat quality. Therefore, we proposed a restoration workflow based on species differential analysis (SDA) and implemented it in this area in 2013. The SDA method determined the bird species (i.e. target species) for which habitat could be restored by analyzing the existing, surrounding, and historical bird community in the area. We screened for target species using SDA and used these species as a basis for site zoning, habitat restoration projects, and recruitment measures. Both species richness and species diversity of the birds in the HNWP increased rapidly from 2014 to 2016 and remained stable in 2017 to 2018. In contrast, the species richness and species diversity in the control area where the SDA method was not used only reached the values of the area where this method was used in 2017. This shows that the SDA-based method could improve bird diversity effectively and rapidly. In addition, the proportion of waterbirds and migratory birds in the park also increased, indicating that the habitats that were restored for the waterbirds showed an improvement in quality. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration","bird diversity; community composition; habitat restoration; species richness; target species; wetland park","China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; bird; community composition; habitat restoration; national park; recruitment (population dynamics); restoration ecology; species diversity; wetland management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099466098"

While marine parks aim to meet this challenge by regulating fishing through zoning plans, their effectiveness hinges on compliance levels and may respond to changes in fishing practices. Here we use a speciose assemblage of nominally herbivorous reef fish in Karimunjawa National Park (zoned since 1989) to investigate whether areas subject to a restrictive management regime sustained higher biomass over seven years compared to areas where moderate and permissive regulations apply. Using a trait-based approach we characterize the functional space of the entire species pool and ask whether changes in biomass translate into changes in functional structure. We track changes in predator biomass, benthic community structure, and fishing practices that could influence herbivore trajectories. Overall herbivore biomass doubled in 2012 compared to 2006–2009 and remained high in 2013 across all management regimes. We found no evidence that this biomass build-up resulted from predator depletion or increased food availability but suggest it emerged in response to a park-wide cessation of fishing with large drive nets known as muroami. The biomass increase was accompanied by a modest increase in taxonomic richness and a slight decrease in community-scale rarity that did not alter functional redundancy levels. Subtle changes in both functional specialization and identity of assemblages emerged as generalist species with low intrinsic vulnerability to fishing recovered sooner than more vulnerable specialists. While this implies a recovery of mechanisms responsible for the grazing of algal turfs and detritus, restoring other facets of herbivory (e.g., macroalgal consumption) may require more time. An increase in the cost-benefit ratio per journey of muroami fishing facilitated a ban on muroami nets that met minimal resistance. Similar windows of opportunity may emerge elsewhere in which gear-based regulations can supplement zoning plans, especially when compliance is low. This does not advocate for implementing such regulations once a fishery has become unprofitable. Rather, it underlines their importance for breaking the cycle of resource depletion and low compliance to zoning, thus alleviating the resulting threats to food security and ecosystem integrity. © 2019 The Authors.

Inductively- coupled plasma atomic emission spectral analysis is used to test for the gross and average ratio of 17 metals and metalloids (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ge, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, Ti, V, Zn) in Hypogymnia physodes lichen samples. The average content of the most elements identified in samples from Zavidovo National Park (ZNP) is higher than in the samples from Central Forest State Nature Biosphere Reserve (CFSNBR). There are such metals as titanium, copper, arsenic, cobalt, molybdenum, and tin among them. Differences are the result of different levels and regimens of air moisture saturation, localization of working production plants, degree of anthropogenic transformation of the territory. Spatial distribution of areas with much higher metal concentrations on reserve territory is resulted apparently from variation in air humidity to large extent. In ZNP addiction between qualitative and quantitative metal impact is defined more clearly by level and character of artificial territory transformation. Moreover, in ZNP wide marshy and forest areas in valley on the Lob' river were identified, which have conservation importance as they are characterized by lack or very low concentrations of many metals. So it would be useful to take advantage while zoning and correction of regimes. © 2020 Publishing House ""O- Kratkoe"".

Therefore, Landscape proves a suitable concept both for the enhancement of cultural features and for nature conservation. The aim of this work is to apply the landscape approach to the Pantelleria National Park, providing the opportunity to reflect upon and discuss whether and how to encompass rural landscape planning and management within the broader context of natural values, offering a frame of reference for the zoning of the future Park Plan. Specifically, the research aims to define zoning categories, typical to protected areas planning, using criteria related to landscape features and patterns, environmental quality, traditional agriculture, architectural heritage. Established in 2016, the Pantelleria National Park is the most recent Italian National Park and the first one in Sicily. The Park covers 79% of the island, encompassing two sites of Community Importance as well as one Special Protection Area belonging to the Natura 2000 network. Pantelleria is a microcosm gathering a great variety of natural and human-made landscapes characterized by high levels of complexity embodying the antagonism of two protected ‘noble interests’: Nature and the environment on the one hand, Culture framed as traditional rural practices on the other. The main challenge of the new-founded National Park is to combine quality and values relating to the domain of Nature, which is expanding, with those expressed by Culture, represented by a wide array of historical rural values at risk due to ongoing abandonment of most remote areas. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed at analysing the acceptance of the local population within one of the historical national parks of Italy, the Stilfserjoch National Park (NP). This NP is particularly suited to such an investigation for a number of reasons: it presents a very complex landscape and a wide altitude range; it is characterized by strong human influence and different land management types; some of the inhabitants within the NP belong to the Italian-, others to the German-speaking ethnic group and the NP covers three Italian regions, each with its own past and cultural history. We identified determinants of influence on the basis of a representative survey. Explorative analyses with discriminant analyses as classification method revealed a subordinated role for achieving acceptance of both the attitude towards nature and the work of the National Park Administration (NPA). According to our findings, perceptions in the local population are formed in a three-step-process starting with environmental education to identifying and answering the social needs of the residents to acknowledging personal needs by minimizing disadvantages for individuals. All in all, the results show that a survey of the population carried out in the presented way can make a major contribution to focusing the work of the NPA and to minimizing activities in 'fruitless tasks'.","Key factors; Local population; Nature protection; Perception; Zoning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84871953818"

The land issues revealed by the zoning of the national park in the context of exponential population growth lead to new alliances, notably with the previously marginalized traditional authorities, which reaffirm their territorial rights in the process of nature patrimonializatkm. We show how the local strategies at work are in keeping with the old cultural model of each of these communities, centered on the territory and not on the biodiversity it contains.

In Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, where elephant populations have been increasing, management have adopted a zonation approach, with zones identified for specific and measurable management interventions to control elephant populations, or to reduce conflict with humans. Localised culling is one proposed management intervention. The zones, partly derived from static annual elephant distribution surveys, are intended to encompass only localised effects on elephant within that zone, assuming no effect into adjacent undisturbed zones, or into contiguous neighbouring landholdings outside KNP. We deployed 17 GPS/GSM collars on free-roaming elephant herds within KNP to assess their seasonal home-range use and size and daily movement paths. These temporally robust movement metrics were analyzed against the Park's elephant management zones, partly derived from sporadic telemetry fixes and static distribution counts. Multiple daily and seasonal spatial shifts by elephant across neighbouring zones, including into adjacent reserves, rendered the principle of exclusive zoning at this management scale incorrect. The KNP management zones and proposed management actions are not biologically relevant to elephant, or appropriate for managing the ecological or human-wildlife impact of elephant, resulting in spatial and temporal scale mismatches. We predict that the intended management actions, specifically culling, and its resultant intended consequences (immigration, reduced vegetation impact and reduced growth due to disturbance) is not localised to the target zone, and, because it is season specific, is at risk of targeting transient non-resident elephant whilst missing resident elephant that have crossed into other zones. This scale mismatch may have a ripple effect outside the target zone, causing serious ecological risks, especially given the documented long-term negative effects of management disturbance on elephant. We further quantify this scale mismatch into four categories based on percentages of the following factors: the proportion of sampled population affected, the seasonal zone occupancy (the proportion of locations per zone per season) and number of zone crossings, and the governance of management units (consistency of management interventions imposed across zones). This generates a prediction of the risk of this exclusive zoning and its consequences. We suggest a new approach, whereby, known elephant intensity of use at local scales is adaptively managed for specific management objectives. However, management must occur within a known and contained zone of influence defined by elephant behaviour derived from resident movement studies, as opposed to broad scale zonation at the population or park level. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Elephant; Kruger National Park; Management effects; Ranging behaviour; Scale mismatch","Kruger National Park; South Africa; ecosystem structure; ecotourism; elephant; governance approach; GPS; growth response; keystone species; management practice; policy making; population structure; species conservation; temporal analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84882932368"

Livestock movement patterns indicated that forage is the motivation for winter movements and water is the motivation for summer. The movement followed a predictable direction from grazing areas in the wet season towards the Orange River riparian area with permanent water during periods of low rainfall. The latter can be considered as a 'key resource' area to sustain animal numbers through critical periods of low rainfall. Overall, seasonal movement patterns were in transect of approximately 10km in distance. However, these patterns varied amongst the pastoralists which suggest diverse approaches to tracking resources. On average, a pastoralist moved his animals six times a year between stock posts in a network of grazing routes. The grazing area around a stock post was 2.49km comprising an area of ca. 1 950ha. Herds walked much more quickly in the morning (1.25km hr-1) than in the afternoon (0.82km hr-1) and thus covered more grazing ground per unit time. On the basis of the grazing area and travelling rate (particularly in the morning), all the 36 identified conservation-worthy sites in the National Park were threatened by livestock grazing. Effective management strategies may possibly include zoning, closing some stock posts and careful consideration for opening new roads.

Knowing this, national park staff at Lake Mead National Recreation Area in the southwestern United States had a program in place for early detection of the non-native, invasive quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis. ). Upon finding the mussel in January 2007, managers moved quickly to access funding and the best available science to implement a response. Managers considered four options-doing nothing, closing the park, restricting movement on the lakes, and educating and enforcing park visitors-and decided to focus on education and enforcing existing laws. Nonetheless, quagga spread throughout the park and soon began to appear throughout the western United States. I examined why efforts to control the expansion failed and determined the general lessons to be learned from this case. Concentrating human visitation on the lakes through land-use zoning opened a pathway for invasion, reduced management options, and led to the rapid spread of quagga. To reconcile competing mandates to protect nature and provide recreation, zoning in parks has become a common practice worldwide. It reduces stress on some areas of a park by restricting and thus concentrating human activity in particular areas. Concentrating the human activity in one area does three things: cements pathways that repeatedly import and export vectors of non-native invasive species; creates the disturbed area necessary to enable non-native invasive species to gain a foothold; and, establishes a source of invasions that, without appropriate controls, can quickly spread to a park's wilderness areas. ©2010 Society for Conservation Biology.","Conservation mandate; Dreissena rostriformis bugensis; Invasive species; Land-use zoning; National park; Non-native; Protected area; Quagga mussels","Animals; Bivalvia; Conservation of Natural Resources; Demography; Nevada; Population Dynamics; Recreation; Lake Mead; United States; Dreissena; Dreissena bugensis; Dreissena rostriformis; Equus quagga; biodiversity; bivalve; conservation management; environmental legislation; human activity; invasive species; land use; national park; recreational activity; recreational management; animal; article; bivalve; demography; economics; environmental protection; methodology; physiology; population dynamics; recreation; United States; bivalve; environmental protection; physiology; procedures","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954748887"

Environmental reporting on China has tended to focus on environment damage, especially air pollution. Relatively unnoticed in the West, however, China has invested in improving and expanding its system of protected areas. These protected areas follow varied models—they include nature reserves, forest parks, wetland parks, and more—and face challenges roughly similar to those of protected areas in the United States and many other countries. Unsurprisingly, though, there are important differences that make China's protected area program uniquely Chinese. Chinese protected areas have been largely created and continue to be developed with strong top-down authority, although national-level control is softening and other models are being tested. Several nature reserves have received influxes of government funding in recent years to improve and expand their infrastructure and activities to support conservation, tourism, and other uses. Chinese nature reserves also tend to have explicit zoning and economic activities designed to promote economic development in and around them; this emphasis on economic development is greater and takes a different approach in Chinese parks than is typical in Western park systems. Here we compare aspects of the Chinese and US investments in national parks and national nature reserves; we use two examples—Wudalianchi National Nature Reserve in China and Acadia National Park in the United States—to highlight similarities and differences. We conclude that each country's approach to protected areas has strengths and weaknesses in terms of conservation value, engagement with local communities, and sustainability, but that overall each country's protected areas program has structural deficiencies, particularly related to the allocation of funding, that undermine their ability to achieve their stated mission over the long term. The shortcomings in each country are different and may not be as substantial as the shortcomings of` national parks in many other countries, but they are critical nonetheless. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Acadia National Park; Economic development; Investments; Protected areas; US National Park Service; Wudalianchi National Nature Reserve","Acadia National Park; China; Heilongjiang; Maine; United States; Wudalianchi National Park; comparative study; conservation status; economic development; environmental economics; governance approach; investment; local participation; nature reserve; protected area; valuation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992445786"

The primary purpose of the nature reserve zone and the specially protected zone is to ensure the conditions for the preservation of the unique natural complexes along the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk. Within these territories, economic activity and recreational utilization are prohibited. The zones of educational and recreational tourism provide the conditions for spiritual, scientific and educational recreation and imply different modes of visitation. Natural sites are highlighted, which are of interest as touristic resources. The development of touristic activity in the islands of National Park involves creating on the territories of the recreational zone a number of economic facilities and service centers for visitors. Special emphasis is placed on the protection zone for historical sites that includes the chapel in commemoration of the discoverers of Shantar Islands, and the territory of the former plant for whale oil processing. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","biological diversity; functional zones; natural complexes; nature conservation; recreation","Khabarovsk [Russian Federation]; Pacific Ocean; Russian Federation; Sea of Okhotsk; Shantar Islands; Cetacea; biodiversity; coastal zone; economic activity; environmental issue; national park; nature conservation; nature reserve; recreational development; tourism development; whale","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975827992"

These ecosystems include mangroves, but also encompass coastal peatswamp forest and freshwater swamp forest. Solutions to the conservation problems require strategies which put individual areas into a regional and giobeographic content and address not only pressure within each area, but also attempt to solve the causes of these pressures. The coastal wetlands on the east coast of southern Sumatra provide an example of the types of problems that are widespread in the region. They are also of considerable ecological significance for their biodiversity and in regulating tghe ecological conditions of the productive inshore waters of the Java Sea. The Berbak National Park is perhaps the best representation of original peatswamp forest remaining in SE Asia, while the mangrove communities of Sembilang and associated rivers immediately to the south are of paramount value not only because they represent substantially intact natural communities, but also because they contain intact ecological graeitns inland to palmswamp and peatswamp communities above the saltwalter/freshwater interface. The three locations consered in this paper are of international importance as waterbird and wader habitat and Berbak is a Ramsar site. Nevertheless, human pressure is rapidly increasing. Intense pressure on the northern coastline of Jambi Province is driving a growing population along the coastal fringe adjacent to the Berbak National Park, while commercial forestry and a transmigration settlement to the south-west of Sembilang is also a source of increasing human activity. Extensive forest fires during the long dry season of 1994 resulted in widespread destruction of peatswamp forest on the borders of Sembilang and Berbak and allowed further encroachment to occur there. In this paper a set of proposals for conservation of the coastal wetland communities of southern Sumatra are presented. These proposals emphasize a range of land use approaches which contemporary conservation planning have available. They provide examples of local area multiple use and resource substitution techniques, zoning approaches, and potentially significant ecotourism opportunities. Taken together it is argued that these approaches are not only appropriate for site management, but will also relieve pressure associated with a continuing process of ad hoc and planned settlement and conversion which has characterized the region since the 1960s.","","Berbak National Park; Indonesia; Sumatra; coastal wetland; conservation; mangrove; peatswamp forest; swamp forest","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031350175"

Protected area zoning is an approach that can reduce conflict by partitioning the landscape into various land use units that are managed for different levels of human activity. In this paper, we present a systematic methodology that integrates a participatory process with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique to guide a zoning scheme for the Meili Snow Mountain National Park (MSMNP), Yunnan. A participatory process involving multiple stakeholders and technical experts was used to establish park management objectives: nature conservation; tourism and recreation; and, community development. To meet these three objectives, criteria and impact factors for each objective were identified and weighted through a participatory process, and a GIS fuzzy set membership function was then used to generate gradient effects of each criterion. Three suitability maps of conservation, eco-tourism, and community development were generated. The three suitability maps were overlaid to generate a final combined suitability map, and five management zones (strict protected zone, ecosystem conservation zone, eco-tourism zone or buffer zone, park service zone, and traditional land use zone) were identified and mapped that corresponded to different protection and management strategies. Conservation targets (endangered species, alpine and forest ecosystems) and development zones were spatially segregated across the landscape, and the final zoning scheme was found to be acceptable by the various stakeholders. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","Management zoning designation; Meili Snow Mountain National Park; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Participatory process; Protected area zoning","China; Yunnan; decision analysis; ecotourism; GIS; multicriteria analysis; nature conservation; nature reserve; park management; participatory approach; protected area; stakeholder; zoning policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84880039603"

Mapping of the environmental units is based on analytic data regarding lithology, morphology, pedology, climatology, vegetation, fauna, soil use and type of human establishment. The redundancy of the environmental units facilitated their reduction to only 37 types. The naturalistic-aesthetic and historical-cultural evaluation of the environmental units employed criteria (naturalness, rarity, renewability, beauty and diversity) to which were assigned original scales of value. Use of binary values allowed quantification of the criteria related to the types of environmental unit and thus their division by multivariate analysis into 4 relatively homogeneous groups. Cartographic rendition of these 4 groups of types led to the production of a map of preliminary Park zoning, in which it is possible to distinguish 4 functional zones, as requested by the Italian law for national parks.","","Italy; Stelvio National Park; Trentino-Alto Adige; environmental planning; landscape ecology; mapping; national park","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031370839"

However, buffer zones are typically treated as a homogeneous entity without much regard to the intra-zone dynamics. This research examined the impacts of rhinos along with households’ resource use, dependency, involvement and associated impacts within one buffer zone – Kolhuwa Village Development Committee. Household surveys (N=68) were conducted and sampling was based on the type of settlement and land size. A structured and semi-structured questionnaire was used to interview household heads along with GPS points. The buffer zone was segmented into two zones – Close and Far Settlement based on the distance from the park boundary. Results illustrated that the impacts of rhinos were more pronounced among households that were closer to the boundary, and declined with increasing distance. Households had challenges to produce enough food for at least six months to a year, but noticeably more so in the close settlements. Residents that were closer to the boundary were most dependent on fuelwood and natural resources extraction. While both zones were reliant on income from outside their community, households in the close settlements were more dependent. Conversely, households in the far settlements had been involved for more years and in more activities in the buffer zone.

Such megacrysts are generally interpreted as having grown to large sizes early in a magma's crystallization history while they were largely molten, owing to field relations such as megacryst alignment and megacryst-rich clusters and to crystallographic features such as zonally arranged inclusions and sawtooth Ba zoning. These features are consistent with early growth but do not require it. In contrast, experimental petrology, mineral compositions, and natural examples of partial melting of granite demonstrate that K-feldspar is typically the last major phase to crystallize and that most K-feldspar growth occurs after the magma crosses the rheologic lock-up threshold of ~50 % crystals. The near-absence of K-feldspar phenocrysts in dacite lavas and tuffs, even in highly crystalline ones, demonstrates that natural magmas do not precipitate significant K-feldspar while they are mobile. The highly potassic compositions of megacrysts (and indeed, of K-feldspar in non-megacrystic granites as well) require exsolution of albite component down to temperatures of ~400 °C. The low Ca contents of megacrysts cannot result from exsolution of anorthite and must represent recrystallization of the crystals at low temperature. These mineralogical and experimental constraints require that K-feldspar megacrysts indicate widespread and thorough recrystallization of the host granites and granodiorites. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Granite; Granodiorite; K-feldspar; Textural coarsening; Yosemite National Park","California; United States; Yosemite National Park; calc alkaline rock; feldspar; granite; granodiorite; inclusion; megacryst; partial melting; petrology; phenocryst; recrystallization; zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84883223784"

As a result, the natural park system provides three different categories of natural parks: national parks, quasi-national parks and prefectural natural parks. As Japan is a small island country with one of the highest population densities in the world with a long history of private land ownership, it is next to impossible to set aside large park areas specifically for the purpose of protection. To feed the nation, the first priority of land use has been farming and other primary industries. Because of these reasons, the Japanese government had to create natural parks not necessarily where it owned land but where it recognized the need to preserve nature. It is characteristic of Japanese natural parks that various land owners cooperatively maintain the landscape of a park.

In this phase of the research, with the aid of geological maps and types of rocks, in accordance with reference to the Special National Strategy Plan, seismic diagrams and land slides (drifts), in three appropriate zones of durability, semi-suitable and unsuitable have been prepared. In concern with the ground cover conditions, the regional plants are of the Polygonaceae, Leguminesae and the palmaceae families, including a few classifications of weeds and scrubs, small trees, ornamental and fruit bearing trees. Likewise, in the area of study, the bird community is of an acceptable diversity. The presence of several terrestrial and aquatic habitats has lead to a high diversity of birds in the region in having environmental potentials in the area. In the South Pars region, the Naieband National Marine Park and two creeks which are known as Basatin and Bidkhoon are vital environmental banks and suitable locations for spawning and the breeding of aqua life. The proximity with oil and gas installations in the Asalooyeh region can be precarious in two ways. One, in an indirect mode, due to development activities that take place in the area, such as, constructions and littoral structures etc., and in a direct form, due to the perpetual and probable leakage of oil, gas and their derivatives into the regional waters, is possible. According to the census in the year 1996, the township of Kangan had a population of 78,318 persons and with due attention to the economic structure and migration, the area is confronted with a rise in population on the whole. In order to assess and survey the consequences, arising from the South Pars constructional activities on the coastline, as well as the appraisal of the relative potentials and the vulnerability of the various sections, of the implementation location of the project, from a list to recognize occurrences and the matrix, so as to determine and gain an absolute reliability as to the results, two other methods have been utilized. In this study, with the help of determining the slope, soil conditions (from the viewpoint of depth), bed rock (from the viewpoint of durability), ground cover (from the point of view of density), sensitive ecosystems (creeks, the Naieband Gulf and Naieband National Park) and by taking into consideration the specifications and conditions of the limits, proportionate ecological, industrial and residential model surveys of constructions have been prepared in these three aspects and they have been utilized in zoning. After executing the zoning, so as to evaluate and specify the amount of damages caused, due to the various activities, the checklist method was resorted to. The utilization of this method took place in the two phases of construction and exploitation, in 6 of the major or principle regional activities such as, the refinery, petrochemicals, airport, port and docks, gas transition line and transportation. In the checklist used with respect to each of the activities, only the negative consequences as to the exploitation impacts of the environmental factors have been distinguished. These consequences, from the point of view of being a collection of impacts, retrievable and likewise, its impacts on the coastline were surveyed and then the results gained were totalized. In continuation, so as to analyze and appraise the regional environmental impacts and consequences and with due attention to the results of the list, (estimations of the initial impacts), for the recognition of the intensity and importance of the impacts, as well as totalizing the quantitative facets of the impacts and a final decision-making, the impacts predicted in the list method, is in the form of a matrix, in two macro and micro proportions, in which they have been categorized and totalized. With due attention to the results obtained from assessing the capacity, the ecological limits were divided into three zones, the first zone is of 200 hectares, the second zone is of 19,200 hectares and the unsuitable zone, is allocated to 26,300 hectares. In comparing the ecological capacity role of the area, with the special regional development role, illustrates that, approximately 56 percent of the development is in the semi-suitable zone, and 44 percent of the development shall be conducted in the unsuitable zone. With due attention to the fact that since that the development in the region under study, shall be executed in the unsuitable environmental bed, though, due to the vast importance and aptness of the region, in continuance with more accurate surveys of the limits under study with the aid of other methods in connection with the project implementation was taken into discussion. The results of the checklist show that from between the 6 main activities present in the South Pars Development Plan Region, the refinery and petrochemicals, followed by the gas transfer pipelines, has the highest percentage of adverse impacts on the environment. Similarly, the results of the implementation matrixes of the project in the region do not qualify. Due to the outstanding economic benefits of the South Pars region and the joint participation issue, as well as the exploitation of this resource by the southern neighbors of Iran, a termination of the plan activities is not feasible. Therefore, in the continuation of this research, modes to decrease the impacts and environmental monitoring under influence, with due attention to the regional conditions have been rendered. After surveying the impacts of the mentioned plan, on the various environmental components, as well as with emphasis on pollution and environmental destruction as an adverse impact of the project on the environment, the manner to decrement the negative impacts of the project in the region has been given in brief, as follows: Means to reduce the adverse impacts of the project on the physical environment: Conservation and restoration of the regional lands, reducing the impacts arising from the occurrence of inundation in the region, abiding to the 60 meter perimeter from the coast, for several constructional activities in the area, preparing the required equipments for the collection of coastal sand, polluted with oil products, the utilization of suitable chemical compounds for purging oil pollution in the region Manner to decrease the oil impacts on the biological environment: Utilizing recycled water and surface runoffs, utilizing brackish or fresh water resources, Use of irrigation systems prone to slighter consumption, prevention of industrial development in the direction of the Naieband National Park, prevention of the discharge of untreated urban, industrial and agricultural sewage and wastewaters into the sea, abiding to the standards and controlling the temperature of sewage released into the marine water (sea), controlling the leakage from oil pipes and installations, including the particular oil tankers utilized for the replacement of oil produce Method to reduce the adverse impacts on the socio-economic and cultural environment: Performing population scanning studies, executing special tutorial programs, so as to establish coordination between the indigenous populace, abiding in rendering priority to indigenous individuals, in relative to employing manpower Modes to decrement the environmental pollution impacts: Accurate designing of chimneys utilized for pollutants, utilization of filters to decrease pollution in the flares of industrial chimneys, Siting the approved or correct industrial development, with due attention to the direction of wind in the region, sanitary burial of wastes, controlling the infiltration of pollutants into the surface waters and the utilization of sensing equipment, in regards the leakage of pipes. The monitoring program taking into consideration the South Pars region comprises of: Survey of the quality of water resources by sampling and testing the specifications under view, topographical and landform monitoring, in order to control and regulate development procedures, measuring and monitoring sound level. Monitoring air pollution, sample taking of aqua life, taking statistical account of the amount and dispersion of terrestrial fauna and aqua life listed in environmental studies, survey.","Assaluyeh; Check list; Environmental impact; Matrix; Persian golf; South pars","Aves; Magnoliophyta; Polygonaceae","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77952116691"

Originally used in the nineteenth century to refer to protected areas that should be conserved for the consumption of outstanding scenery and natural beauty for the beneﬁt of visitors, the term is now often used as a ‘catch-all’ by members of the public to refer to protected areas of national environmental and cultural signiﬁcance. This situation is not helped by the fact that many national park agencies manage more than just national parks as well as the number of diﬀerent types of protected areas. The IUCN has six diﬀerent categories of protected area with national parks usually being a component of a wider system of protected areas. However, some jurisdictions have even more categories, For example, in Austria there are 12 diﬀerent types of protected areas and 11 in Germany (Mose and Wixlbaumer 2007). In addition, ‘one cannot deny a certain image-hierachy between the diﬀerent categories. In contrast to the prestigious and ﬁnancially lucrative Category II (national park), the Category V (protected landscape) receives only little attention’ (Mose and Wixlbaumer 2007: 5). This is despite the signiﬁcant spatial area occupied by protected landscapes (see Chapter 1), and especially in Europe where it is by far the most substantial protected area category in terms of area occupied. According to Mose and Wixlbaumer (2007: 5) there are several reasons for the dominance of ‘national parks’ over other categories of protected areas in the public and policy imagination: • The outstanding image of national parks as the ‘premium category of the protected areas’; • The stringent legal and spatial planning rules underlying the national parks (for example statutues instead of regulations, zoning of activities); Furthermore, and perhaps not surprisingly, many people often do not recognize the diﬀerences that exist between the diﬀerent types of protected areas or, in some cases, the concept is alien to their world-view (e.g. Kalternborn 1994, Neumann 1998, Proctor 1998, Stoll-Kleemann 2001, Trakolis 2001a, 2001b, Hall and Piggin 2002, Kächele and Dabbert 2002, Kalternborn et al. 2002, McLean and Stræde 2003, Middleton 2003, Phillips 2003, Mascarenhas and Scarce 2004, Hovardas and Poirazidis 2007, Schenk et al. 2007). © 2009 Warwick Frost and C.

Using informal interviews with 66 respondents, fishery laws are still poorly implemented partly due to lack of participation among stakeholders. Enforcement of fishery laws and regulations at Bunaken National Park remains problematic, mainly due to lack of cooperation from the coastal communities. More than half (53%) of the respondents agreed that they are aware of the conservation efforts at BNP (mainly due to mass media such as television and trusted public figures) as well as pertinent laws and regulations (e.g. zoning and fishery laws). However, most respondents (73%) claimed that they disagree with these laws and regulations and even viewed these as not profitable to fishers and not part of the solution to conserve BNP. In addition, willingness to comply with fishery laws is still low based on interviews with respondents. Willingness to participate with BNP’s enforcement body was also notably low (< 25% of the respondents). As expected, all respondents agreed that BNP lacks facilities to enforce the laws and regulations. A brief comparison of management histories between Bunaken National Park and few successful examples such as those in central Philippines is also provided. © 2017, BIOFLUX SRL.

Environmental supply includes natural features, physical attributes, management initiatives and/or governance policies that influence environmental conservation. Environmental supply, therefore, will include the ecosystems of the park destination, visitor education and interpretive programs, zoning and access, environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedures, policies and guidelines, and any other characteristics and initiatives that impact the conservation and/or preservation of nature at a visitor-centered site. How commercial tour operators respond to andmanage these for environmental protection in a conservation environment will determine tourism sustainability at the destination. This evaluation includes presentation of the results of 16 one-on-one field interviews from an illustrative sample of 85 commercial tour operators (managers) within Banff and Jasper national park boundaries (from June to November, 2011). Each interview included nine formal questions, ranging from a description of the types of activities included in tours to actual or perceived limitations placed on operators when locating within a national park. Three of the questions targeted specifically tour operator's understanding of environmental supply.

We then used the software Marxan to generate cost-efficient reserve networks that represented every biotope in the Park. We asked what were the potential gains and losses in terms of fishing effort and species conservation of different planning scenarios. Given a conservation target of 10 % representation of each biotope, the fishery need not lose more than 20 % of its fishing grounds to give way to cost-efficient conservation of benthic diversity.

This study explores how various stakeholders employ zoning in the Numto Nature Park in the oil-rich Russian Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug–Yugra to advance their interests and how they use scientific information to achieve this. Through stakeholder interviews, analysis of electronic media and literature review, we conclude that a participatory and science-based zoning exercise stimulates the necessary deliberation. However, legal ambiguity, deficient law implementation and informal practices limit the zoning's potential to balance stakeholders’ interests. All the stakeholders calculatingly used scientific information to legitimize their own ambitions, activities and claims. Hence, zoning and the underlying information claims should be interpreted as both a resource and a battleground in nature-use conflicts. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

In this paper, an interdisciplinary method combining spatial multi-criteria analysis (SMCA), geographic information system (GIS) and stakeholder consultation to develop a zoning scheme in the multiple-use MPAs of Eritrea is illustrated. Three higher-level criteria and eight lower-level criteria are identified based on the value-focused approach to multi-criteria analysis, and stakeholder preference is represented by pair-wise comparison (AHP analysis). Subsequently, the simple additive weighting (SAW) method is used to determine the suitability of an area for each protection level using spatial analysis software. Through this study, a zoning scheme considering both the scientific soundness and the practical feasibility of the Sheik Seid Marine National Park (SSMNP) in the Eritrean waters is proposed.

The environmental variables considered for the model were: depth; slope; habitat type and heterogeneity; wave exposure; and MPA zoning. A total of 378 transects were randomly distributed with a total of 149,000 m2 surveyed at a depth range from 4.2 to 46 m. The recorded P. nobilis densities are among the highest in the Mediterranean Sea. With respect to the prediction model, results indicate that benthic habitats play a key role in the spatial distribution of P. nobilis, with higher densities in seagrass meadows of Posidonia oceanica. The fan mussel population density peaked at 9 m depth, decreasing with depth. Also, decreasing densities are expected with increasing exposure to waves. The predicted map shows some hotspots of density different in size and distributed along the MPA, and provides valuable information for the spatial conservation management of this species.","Benthic mapping; Mediterranean Sea; MPAs; Pinna nobilis; Protected species; Regression kriging; Species distribution model","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84913530762"

Approximately 25% of households depended on fishing as their main source of income, with boat owners earning average net wages of 7-68 US$/ day in small-scale fisheries. Apparently unaware of restrictions on resource use, small-scale fishers reported working in 95% of the park's marine waters.

Based on this, a zonification of the Sistema Arrecifal Veracruzano National Park is proposed, which considers the identification of various subsystems, seascapes and environmental units within nested scales, to be included in the national park management plan. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Since then, the road network has expanded from the Indian boarder, often tracing traditional trails. This has accelerated commerce as well as movement of people from India, benefitting both the Bhutanese and foreign tourists. At the same time, dependence on imported automobiles and fossil fuel has risen, and roadless areas have begun to shrink. This brought an inevitable loss of traditional environmental knowledge, such as the care of mules for packing, and reduction in physical and mental health among the Bhutanese. People who lost jobs as horsemen moved into towns to find jobs. Road extension is also a double-edged sword for visitors. It has resulted in shrinking trekking areas and loss of traditional culture, both of which have been sacrificed for easy access. Protected areas often function as fortifications against mechanical civilization. However, protected-area status or its zoning does not guarantee that an area will remain roadless where there is considerable resident population. An analysis in Jigme Dorji National Park showed the gradual retreat of trailheads and increasing dependence on automobiles among residents and trekkers. B. MacKaye, a regional planner in the Eastern United States, proposed using trails as a tool to control such mechanical civilization. His philosophy of regional planning suggests two measures; one is consolidated trailheads as dams, and the other is confinement of roads by levees, consisting of new trails and wilderness belts. According to case studies, the author proposed six options for coexistence of trails with roads. © 2011 by the authors.","Bhutan; Inhabited wilderness; Roadless area; Traditional environmental knowledge; Trailhead; Trekking","Bhutan; Jigme Dorji National Park; Conservation; Fossil fuels; Regional planning; Bhutan; Environmental knowledge; Inhabited wilderness; Roadless areas; Trailhead; Trekking; environmental planning; recreational activity; regional planning; road construction; sustainability; traditional knowledge; wilderness area; Roads and streets","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84869226532"

Spatial interactions between the trail network and the decreased vegetation areas were tested using Cross K-functions to assess whether or not the existing trail network attracted more vegetation impact in a spatial context. The results showed no statistically significant differences between the two zones in terms of the amounts of recovery and impact (all p values >0.05), indicating that the magnitudes of impact and recovery were similar regardless of the proximity to the trail. Nonetheless, the applied methods based on zoning and spatial interaction analyses were useful for identifying spatially explicit patterns of vegetation impact related to the hiking trail network.","recreation; remote sensing; spatial interaction; trampling; vegetation cover change","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84905266561"

To gain a greater understanding of such conflict we examined spatio-temporal patterns, correlates, causes and contexts of conflict in Chitwan National Park, Nepal, and its buffer zone, during 2007-2014. Data, mostly from compensation applications, were collected from the Park office. Fifty-four human casualties (32 fatalities, 22 injuries) and 351 incidents of livestock depredation were recorded, clustered in defined areas, with 75.9% of human casualties occurring in the buffer zone and 66.7% within 1 km of the Park boundary. A linear model indicated there was a significant increase in human casualties during 2007-2014. Livestock were killed in proportion to their relative availability, with goats suffering the highest depredation (55%). There was a positive correlation between livestock depredation and National Park frontage (the length of Village Development Committee/municipality boundary abutting the National Park), but not human population, livestock population, forest area in the buffer zone, rainfall or temperature. There was no relationship between tiger attacks on people and any of the correlates examined. Wild prey density was not correlated with conflict. Of the tigers removed because of conflict, 73.3% were male. The majority of attacks on people occurred during accidental meetings (77.8%), mostly while people were collecting fodder or fuelwood (53.7%), and almost half (48.2%) occurred in the buffer zone forests. We recommend the use of the conflict map developed here in the prioritization of preventive measures, and that strategies to reduce conflict should include zoning enforcement, improvement of livestock husbandry, participatory tiger monitoring, an insurance scheme, and community awareness.

Within the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff (HRT; Idaho, USA), representing the earliest and largest caldera-forming eruption associated with Yellowstone volcanic activity, zircon morphological zoning patterns coupled to strongly correlated changes in Ti-in-zircon thermometry and trace element indicators of progressive differentiation provide a proxy record for the evolution of the HRT member B magma body. Tandem in situ and isotope dilution U-Pb dating of single zircon crystals demonstrates an absence of pre-Pleistocene xenocrysts, but reveals the presence of antecrysts recycled from pre-caldera rhyolites in the HRT magma. The petrochronologic interpretation of autocrystic zircon thermal, chemical, and temporal characteristics suggests that HRT member B differentiated over ~10 k.y. prior to eruption at 2.0794 ± 0.0046 Ma as defined by new astronomically calibrated, single-crystal total fusion 40Ar/39Ar sanidine analyses. This refined eruption age demonstrates that the transitional polarity preserved by HRT member B does not record the Reunion subchron, but rather a separate, younger geomagnetic event.

However, the lack of zoning is common for most protected areas in developing countries and, as a consequence, many protected areas are not effective in achieving the goals for which they were created. In this work, we introduce a quantitative method to expeditiously zone protected areas and we evaluate its ecological implications on hypothetical zoning cases. A real-world application is reported for the Talampaya National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Argentina. Our method is a modification of the zoning forest model developed by Bos [Bos, J., 1993. Zoning in forest management: a quadratic assignment problem solved by simulated annealing. Journal of Environmental Management 37, 127-145.]. Main innovations involve a quadratic function of distance between land units, non-reciprocal weights for adjacent land uses (mathematically represented by a non-symmetric matrix), and the possibility of imposing a connectivity constraint. Due to its intrinsic spatial dimension, the zoning problem belongs to the NP-hard class, i.e. a solution can only be obtained in non-polynomial time [Nemhausser, G., Wolsey, L., 1988. Integer and Combinatorial Optimization. John Wiley, New York.]. For that purpose, we applied a simulated annealing heuristic implemented as a FORTRAN language routine. Our innovations were effective in achieving zoning designs more compatible with biological diversity protection. The quadratic distance term facilitated the delineation of core zones for elements of significance; the connectivity constraint minimized fragmentation; non-reciprocal land use weightings contributed to better representing management decisions, and influenced mainly the edge and shape of zones. This quantitative method can assist the zoning process within protected areas by offering many zonation scheme alternatives with minimum cost, time and effort. This ability provides a new tool to improve zoning within protected areas in developing countries. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Research and assessments carried out since 1988 showed an increasing environmental impact of extractive actions resulting in a decline of coral cover and density of fish, mollusc and other marine populations, generating negative effects in the only coral reef in the Gulf of California. The growing importance of tourism activities, especially eco-tourism, as a source of employment and welfare creates the opportunity to shift from extractive actions to a sustainable tourism approach. The purpose of this study was to develop a rigorously planned management strategy to improve the health of the environment and the quality of life of the human population of Cabo Pulmo. The methods used included micro region zoning through a Geographical Information System and capacity of use evaluation, integrating the physical, biological, economical and social characteristics of the study area. Based on the evaluation of indexes of fragility, pressure, and vulnerability, 31 environmental units were proposed. The results showed that the predominant environmental policy would be sustainable management within 40% of the total area, restoration in 1%, and a conservation and protection policy in 48%. The sites with most human impact would need an environmental management policy, with the encouragement of sustainable tourism, while eliminating and further excluding any extreme use or high density traditional tourism. Many workshops and meetings have been organized to recommend management actions focusing on sustainable tourism and to discuss how to tailor specific features. After more than 15 years, a recent evaluation of this coralline system, now a National Park, demonstrated that the quality of life of the local inhabitants has improved, and that there is a healthier ecosystem with coral recovery, and many sea turtles, sharks, other fish and invertebrates. © 2010 WIT Press.","coral reef; management plan; sustainable tourism","Baja California Sur; Cabo Pulmo; Gulf of California; Mexico [North America]; Pacific Ocean; Anthozoa; Cheloniidae; Chondrichthyes; Invertebrata; Mollusca; action plan; conference proceeding; coral reef; ecotourism; environmental management; environmental policy; GIS; national park; sport fishing; tourism management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-78549289584"

Even without species that are typical of the Cerrado, official maps consider these mountainsides as open savannas, a mistake that was possibly due either to the difficulty to discern, on satellite images, different kinds of open vegetation on sandy soils, to the degradation of forests, or to the scale employed in biome delimitation.

We analyze the features of the raw-material economy, which is still typical for Russian regions, and then we argue that contextual factors are crucial for the success of community-based governance of CPRs in creation and development of protected areas. Our focus is on the creation of the Alkhanay National Park, which was a unique event because of the competition between two rival projects: gold mining and a national park. Local contextual factors of holy Buddhist places, natural attractions, and long-standing traditions of health treatment in mineral springs played key roles. Remote contextual factors, such as the participation of Siberian scientists of the Russian Academy of Sciences in the project and the state ownership of natural resources in this area, also played a positive role in the process. A very important instrument for community-based governance is functional zoning, where different community interests of agricultural, historical, and cultural traditions; religious and native customs; and a new economy based on tourism and recreation are taken into account.

The highway is a popular access route for visitors traveling from Cody, WY to Yellowstone National Park. This river corridor is also an important habitat for a growing population of grizzly bears. The Shoshone National Forest is currently proposing a major reconstruction of recreation facilities along the highway corridor. This has presented the Forest with an excellent opportunity to recreate facilities that encourage more appropriate human behavior in grizzly habitat. This concept for campground design is a composite of many design strategies currently used internationally in bear habitat designs and information derived from current research in bear/human conflict, grizzly bear behavior and bear habitat use and habitat assessment. The application of this concept to recreational facilities in the North Fork Corridor is the product of an interagency design team of landscape architects and biologists from the US Forest Service, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service in the Greater Yellowstone Area. The design process involves identifying local grizzly bear use patterns and zoning campground components to accommodate these patterns. The most vulnerable facilities (tent pads), are located furthest from bear travel corridors and food preparation areas. Buffer zones, leave strips, trails and barriers are used to help direct bear travel around the campground. Food storage facilities, garbage facilities, cooking sites, and other attractants are consolidated. Human access into bear travel zones is structurally controlled. A major focus of the design is to emphasize the presence of the bear through the actual layout of campground facilities and to capitalize on the unique experience of camping in the grizzly bear's domain.","Grizzly bear-human conflicts; Recreation planning","Shoshone National Forest; United States; Wyoming; bear; recreational activity; recreational development; tourism management; wildlife management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032495223"

One of the most important measures to protect the areas is to calculate the maximum number of tourists that can simultaneously reside in a region, i.e. the determination of the carrying capacity. This paper outlines a method for determining carrying capacity based on zoning of environmental resources and zoning within a region. The paper argues for a return to the idea of identifying maximum appropriate number of users. The main hypothesis of the paper is based on the statement that the development of tourism in Fruška Gora (Mountain) National Park in Northern Serbia must be in accordance with the basic principles of sustainability, including the determination of carrying capacity. The main research goal was to show the opinion of local residents about the uncontrolled development of tourism, and to determine the carrying capacity in four sports and recreational zones of the mountain.

The park is famous for its impressive sandstone formations.1 It was established in 1963 for the purpose of protecting a pristine area with much emphasis on conserving the sandstone formations and the montane and Afro-Alpine grassland biome.2 The GGHNP is situated in QwaQwa, which is well known for lacking sustainable development,3 and has been declared a Presidential Nodal Point because of high poverty, population growth and unemployment. These problems persist despite the fact that the park is the province's major tourist attraction. Previous research in and around the park has focused on geology, palaeontological finds, slope forms and the prominent lichen weathering,1 and remarkably little has been done on the institutional framework and policy environment governing the management and conservation of park resources. The current park management plan was compiled in 2011. This plan provides the legal base for managing resources in the GGHNP. The absence of a comprehensive database on heritage sites complicates the park management process. Whilst remarkable progress has been made in zoning the park to establish a coherent spatial framework, more still needs to be done in using GIS to develop an Environmental Management System. Here we explore the extent to which the current institutional framework and policy initiatives in the management plan foster collaboration between community and national bodies, for purposes of enhancing conservation and the economic potential of heritage resources whilst broadening the scope for scientific research. The broad objective of the park management plan is to conserve biodiversity, with an emphasis on provision of an excellent learning platform, sustainable tourism opportunities and building of cooperation between stakeholders in order to promote local and regional economic development. © 2013 The Authors.","Golden gate; Heritage conservation; Local economic development; Management plan; Park resources","Free State; Golden Gate Highlands National Park; Lesotho; Maluti Mountains; South Africa; economic development; GIS; heritage conservation; local economy; national park; nature conservation; paleontology; population growth; sandstone","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84890201250"

To answer this question, we surveyed plants growing on and off the mounds created by Siberian marmots (Marmota sibirica) among 14 landscape positions and within a single mountain slope in a forested steppe region of Mongolia. Significant interactions between landscape position and soil disturbance by marmots were seen in forb volume. The impact of soil disturbance on species composition was low in mountain areas and high on depositional plains. Soil disturbance may have changed microenvironments from xeric to more humid or from moist to more xeric, depending on the other site characteristics. Collectively, our results suggest that sedimentation and pre-existing water conditions modify the relationships between soil disturbance and landscape position. Because the landscapes can be divided clearly into those that received only positive influences and those that received only negative influence from the marmot disturbance, zoning becomes more meaningful. Our a priori evaluation of the influence of keystone engineers on ecosystems at a broad scale could provide insights into how to optimize the performance of ecosystem engineering in a way that is beneficial to ecosystem management. © 2010 The Authors.

Being a rural settlement in the forest, the village was founded by the Polish refugees in 1842, with the approval of Ottoman Empire. Originally designed on a temporary basis, it turned into a permanent rural settlement when the immigrating population began to stay. This society reflected their own lifestyle and cultural structure in this village. Although tourism became prominent through the hunting activities in early 1900s, the traditional structure had been preserved for a long time, leaning on agriculture and livestock. Thanks to the infrastructural improvement activities conducted since 1970s, Polonez village began to attract more visitors. Following the inauguration of the Second Bosphorus Bridge in 1988, the interconnecting road allowed easier transportation to Polonez village, and tourism became even more prominent for the development of the village. Being recognized as a ""Natural Park"" in 1994 and a ""Natural Protected Area"" in 1995, the village has been able to focus on tourism activities by preserving its authentic nature for a long time, and it has become even more attractive in respect of touristic investments. Currently being an important centre of attraction for daily recreation activities as well as weekend tourism particularly due to its close proximity to Istanbul, Polonez village holds tourism on top of the list, considering its activity structure. 426 people live in the village in accordance with the 2013 data, it is inaccessible by public transport, and there are quite a range of guesthouses and hotels for lodging. Offering an opportunity to visit historical places, to taste local food, to use picnic areas, to take place in a range of touristic activities including nature sports, creative activities and festivals, Polonez village currently faces a change in its structure due to the amendment made on the zoning plan in November 2013, and the recent infrastructure activities conducted within its periphery. Although the village preserved its authentic structure for decades thanks to the consciousness actions of its people as well as the legal restriction, it is now feared that the draft zoning amendment may pave the way for housing, and its authentic characteristics will fade away, with negative effects on its sustainable development.","Istanbul; Metropolitan areas; Polonez village; Rural tourism; Sustainable development; Turkey","Istanbul [Istanbul (PRV)]; Istanbul [Turkey]; Turkey; metropolitan area; national park; peripheral region; rural area; sustainable development; tourism development; tourist attraction; village; zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945961221"

In this study, we seek to discuss some of the challenges to effective buffer zones, focusing our attention on investigating two instruments used for the planning of these areas: the management plan of protected areas, and the municipal master plan. To achieve this, we evaluated the planning of land use around protected areas, as established in the management plans of four protected areas, located in southeastern Brazil, as well as in the master plans of the municipalities covered by these protected areas. We found that these management plans established recommendations rather than specific rules for the use of resources of the buffer zones. Additionally, we verified no uniformity between the master plans on the topic of municipal zoning in the BZs of the PAs studied: only five of the fourteen master plans surveyed delineated a zone around the protected area and defined guidelines for land use consistent with its protection. The results of this study indicate that the use of the buffer zone as an effective strategy for the management of protected areas requires a link between the PA managers and the local government responsible for land use planning, in order to facilitate the articulation between the management plan of the PA and the municipal master plan. Otherwise, the establishment of the buffer zone risks being only a symbolic action, with no practical effect on biodiversity conservation within the protected area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Buffer zone; Management plan; Protected areas","Atlantic Forest; Brazil; action plan; biodiversity; buffer zone; environmental management; environmental planning; guideline; land use planning; local government; national park; occupation; protected area","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039432617"

They are traces that can work to shape peoples’ claims to particular spaces, both materially and semiotically. This article examines the ways in which such mark-making is caught up in contestations over the legitimate use of spaces deemed ‘wild’ and ‘natural’. It draws upon a mobile and video ethnographic study of walkers and mountain bikers in the Cairngorms National Park, Scotland, to explore how the marks made on the ground through outdoor recreation become caught up in struggles over appropriate ways to move one’s body in nature. Here, a process of informal zoning is identified whereby walkers belong in mountains but mountain bikers do not. Emerging from the analysis are the ways in which footprints and tyre-tracks are constituted and contested as ‘damage’ in relation to mountain spaces, and thus used to ascribe or distance culpability from different modes of mobility: walking versus cycling. Particular attention is paid to how such configurations serve as the grounds for excluding certain recreational users from particular outdoor spaces. This article thus identifies traces of movement, and the ways in which they are rendered ‘visible’ or ‘natural’ in talk, action and terrain, as key territorialising devices. In particular, a social and cultural treatment of the environmental impacts of outdoor recreation highlights how absence, as well as presence, of traces can be a powerful device for staking claims to space. The analysis also prompts a greater appreciation of the role of surfaces in constituting particular natures (such as mountains) as natural and wild, and how particular subjects, ways of moving and technologies are implicated, (de)naturalised and disciplined therein. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Cairngorms; environmental impact; inscription; mobility; moral geographies; mountain biking; outdoor recreation; surfaces; territorialisation; walking","Cairngorms National Park; Scotland; United Kingdom; cycle transport; environmental impact; footprint; mobility; movement; national park; outdoor recreation; walking","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942806054"

This article gives an overview of the system of protecting natural resources in Japan, focusing on the national park system. Parks are managed by zoning and regulation, which is unique in that land is not ""set aside"" for nature conservation, but designated as national park wherever the need to preserve ""scenic beauty"" has been recognized, regardless of land ownership or land use. Although resource conservation under this system has been problematic, it has advantages, especially in terms of community participation. This article demonstrates that in order to reach the system's potential, the park authority must act as coordinator of stakeholders and facilitator of bottom-up approaches to decision-making. In order to do this, steps that must be taken include the following: identifying the various stakeholders in park management and defining the ""local community""; clarifying the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder; and supporting consensus-building among stakeholders regarding the objectives and long-term vision of each park. By taking these steps, it would be possible to build a park management system that overrides government boundaries and involves local communities.

Therefore, one fundamental goal in conservation planning is to arrive at nature reserve designs that protect the most valuable lands for conservation, and avoid the inclusion of tracts of land valuable for other stakeholders. However, the complexity of conservation issues, the urgency for protecting critical biodiversity components and the lack of data have forced planners to rely on expert knowledge and public participation for designing nature reserves. Handling expert and public knowledge is challenging because it can be subjective, biased, value laden, context specific, and ambiguous. Here, we present a land suitability assessment (LSA) approach for designing the Sierra San Pedro Mártir National Park, Baja California, Mexico.

Concerns over the extent to which the reserve network was living up to this ideal led to the development of a new strategy in 1995 (the Seville Strategy) to enhance the operation of the network of reserves. An evaluation of effectiveness of management of the biosphere reserve network was called for as part of this strategy. Expert opinion was assembled through a Delphi Process to identify successful and less successful reserves and investigate common factors influencing success or failure. Ninety biosphere reserves including sixty successful and thirty less successful reserves in 42 countries across all five Man and the Biosphere Program regions were identified. Most successful sites are the post-Seville generation while the majority of unsuccessful sites are pre-Seville that are managed as national parks and have not been amended to conform to the characteristics that are meant to define a biosphere reserve. Stakeholder participation and collaboration, governance, finance and resources, management, and awareness and communication are the most influential factors in the success or failure of the biosphere reserves. For success, the biosphere reserve concept needs to be clearly understood and applied through landscape zoning. Designated reserves then need a management system with inclusive good governance, strong participation and collaboration, adequate finance and human resource allocation and stable and responsible management and implementation. All rather obvious but it is difficult to achieve without commitment to the biosphere reserve concept by the governance authorities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biosphere reserves; Delphi approach; Effective management; Failure; Success","Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Expert Testimony; Government; Humans; United Nations; Andalucia; Sevilla; Seville; Spain; biodiversity; conservation management; development failure; forecasting method; landscape structure; national park; nature reserve; participatory approach; resource allocation; stakeholder; sustainable development; UNESCO; awareness; biosphere; clinical article; Delphi study; finance; human; landscape; male; national park; resource allocation; biodiversity; environmental protection; expert witness; government; statistics and numerical data; United Nations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85001038089"

The management of fisheries in KNP uses the zoning system and regulation of fishing gear. This article was written to explain the effectiveness of the zoning system in the management of reef fisheries. The study was conducted in KNP in Jepara Regency, Central Java Province between April and September 2015. The data were collected using the survey method, including both primary and secondary data. The respondents were reef fishers who live in Karimunjawa and Kemujan villages, chosen randomly and numbered 94 people. Secondary data were obtained from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and KNP Authority. The data analysis was done descriptively. The effectiveness of the zoning system was measured from the fishers perception of the zoning, their compliance level, and the number of zoning law violations. The results of this study indicated that most of the fishers (65.95%) state that zone markers are not clearly visible, making it difficult for them to differentiate it. A percentage of 52.13% and 65.96% of the fishers did not reprimand and did not report other fishers who caught fish in the core and protection zones to the KNPA. The fishers compliance level in average was 78.56%. The trend of cases concerning zoning and fishing gear infringements rose linearly between 2002 and 2014. There needs to be more intensive efforts to educate the public about the core and protection zones to build the fishers awareness. © 2016, BIOFLUX SRL.

The high biological and cultural diversity offer diverse opportunities for conservation, despite development threatening both of them. The greatest concentration of biodiversity remain in areas of northern Argentina and southern Bolivia where levels of poverty are very high, and indigenous peoples and poor criollo cattle raisers coexist. By improving informed governance, it is possible to stabilize biodiversity levels and provide a basis for poor local people to collaborate, and to improve their situation in the face of threats from development. In this study we analyze the ongoing processes being applied in two Gran Chaco cases—from the Upper Parapeti Basin (upriver from Kaa Iya National Park) in Bolivia, and the Lower Pilcomayo in northern Argentina (a dynamic internal delta ecosystem where a tri-national biosphere reserve is being considered). Watershed management, when adapted to local ecological, cultural, social and political contexts, is shown to be an effective tactical strategy to activate moribund governmental institutions in response to local constituencies. In the two cases presented, NGO-facilitated processes enriched local people's ability to take their own actions and to assess and frame their problems and goals for dialogue with their governments. The NGOs also offered technical assistance with land-use zoning, reforestation and alternative income-generation activities in collaborations that shifted government engagement. The methods used differ from the standard conservation and development projects, and their success offers lessons in building social network systems and civic science that improve conservation and reduce poverty. We close with a reflection on the framing of poverty alleviation and sustainability in conservation discourse. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Argentina; Bolivia; Environmental governance; Gran Chaco; Riverine wetlands; Watershed management","Bos","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77958515033"

The liberation of Prespa, a remote and rather socially isolated borderline area, from Ottoman occupation took place in 1912-13. Recent events in its environmental history have been forest clearings and human depopulation in the Civil War (1944-49), irrigation system construction in the 1960s, its 'discovery' by ornithologists in the late 1960s, the high emigration rates of 1960-1980, its designation as a National Park in 1974, the destructive development works of 1984-86 after Greece's entry to the EEC and the conversion to intensive bean cultivation in the mid 1980s. The human population of ca 7000 at the start of this century suffered an almost 80% decrease after the Civil War. A resettlement in the mid 1950s increased the population by 40% but in the 1970s emigration reduced it to its previous size of around 1500, still its present size. The extensive and diverse farming systems of previous centuries changed gradually after the construction of an irrigation network in the 1960s, which twenty years later and along with international changes in production and economy patterns, made possible the present day domination of a bean monoculture within irrigated croplands. This was accompanied by increased energy inputs, mechanisation and the use of chemicals. Intensification of agriculture brought increased incomes which attracted also livestock keepers, resulting in a 56% decrease in numbers of livestock in 1964-1993. Cattle are presently kept for meat production only. They graze on the mountains, and no longer in the meadows around the lakeshore. A local shorthorn breed accounting for 93% of all cattle in 1963 declined to less than 18% in 1993. Fishing aimed mainly at carp and Prespa bleak, continues today as in the past to be a source of supplementary income. Eighty-six per cent of the mainly oak and beech - forests are State owned and the rest belong to local municipalities. The forest area has not changed essentially in the last 40 years, but forest roads have expanded. Forests provide mainly fuelwood for local needs and small quantities of industrial timber. No specific management is conducted to safeguard the conservation values of the forest, the majority of which consists of even aged coppiced stands with limited value for wildlife. Manufacturing never played an important role for the economy of the area. Tourism has increased in the last 20 years, concentrated mainly in summer and spring. Accommodation in the villages is not yet satisfactory though it has improved enormously in recent years. The National Park's infrastructure for visitors remains poor. Tourist pressure generally is not yet that high to impact drastically the social and environmental fabric. In places, hunting, angling and poaching can negatively affect the target species. The construction of the irrigation network in the eastern part of Lake Mikri Prespa was the most important change to the landscape and the habitats of Prespa the last 30 years. It resulted in the embankment of free-flowing streams, drainage of wet meadows and dramatic reduction of trees and hedges. In the last 15 years, the reedbeds, no longer burnt or mowed and assisted by increased nutrient loadings from agricultural runoff, have expanded landward to occupy formerly open, periodically flooded, areas. The above changes in habitats and land use have brought an impoverishment of biodiversity which can be seen in the extermination or the decrease in the numbers of certain plant and bird species. The problems preventing a better management of the National Park and the perpetuation of its values are inappropriate legislation, the poor degree of coordination of the public services, the lack of both a specific National Park Service in Greece and a management authority for the Park and the hostile attitude of local people due to their limited information and involvement. The scenic beauty, the wetlands and a number of rare habitats, the diversity of habitats, flora and fauna, the endemic life forms, the rare mammals and the colonial waterbirds, the local architecture and the cultural expressions such as the Byzantine monuments, are the values of Prespa that must be preserved as a whole. The initial conservation efforts aimed at preserving biodiversity but later it became apparent that not only are humans an inseparable part of the whole, but additionally, several of their extensive activities have contributed substantially to the rich biodiversity of the area. Through the prerequisites of keeping a balance between primary and tertiary sector activities and of revitalizing the social fabric, the following are the key management and conservation issues of today: an unequivocal agreement on the values to be preserved and their limits; the formation of a management authority; a new realistic protection and land use zoning; the diversification and extensification of all farming activities; the restoration of the wet meadow habitats; the ensuring of a high water level and a good water quality for both lakes through tri-lateral cooperation between Greece, Albania and FYROM; and the establishment of a permanent environmental monitoring scheme. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Biodiversity conservation; Cultural landscapes; Ecological integrity; Ecosystem management; Greece; Human ecology; Integrated management approach; National park management; Prespa; Protected area management; Wetland conservation; Wetland management","Greece, Prespa National Park; Alburnus alburnus; Aves; Bos taurus; Cyprinus carpio; Fagus; Mammalia; Phaseolus (angiosperm); Quercus; environmental management; native conservation; protected area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030817352"

Although this system faces numerous challenges, it contains a built-in mechanism for facilitating community and stakeholder participation in park management. Fieldwork in Oze, Ogasawara Islands and Yakushima Island, led to a stakeholder analysis, focusing on the dynamics that divide communities in many rural areas and which reflect complex social, economic and political circumstances in contemporary Japan. These dynamics have profound implications for park management, because those with the largest stake have the least influence over local-level decision making.

Earlier studies carried out using remote sensing data pertained to baseline data generation and mapping and monitoring the mangroves (density-wise) of the Park from 1975 to 1993. Using IRS IC/ID LISS III data (1998-2001) supported by ground data, the distribution of different mangrove communities in the Park has been attempted. Amongst various image-processing techniques, band ratioing followed by supervised classification gave the best result (classification accuracy was 92%). Avicennia community is the most dominant community accounting for more than 70% of the area. The Rhizophora community occupies the inward margins of the creeks and the Ceriops community is present in the interior regions. The ecotone between the marsh and mangrove communities has been identified as the transitional mangroves (Avicennia alba, Sueada), representing the transition from the less saline mangrove to the highly saline marsh community. The zoning of the mangroves has also helped in assessing the diversity of the region. Based on the richness of species, three areas, namely Bhains Bid, North-east Dide Ka Bet and South-east Chhad Island have been identified as highly diverse (most suitable area for preservation).","","Avicennia; Avicennia alba; Ceriops; Rhizophora; Rhizophoraceae","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67849120510"

Hence, between the species richness of phytocoenoses and relative density of individuals of dominant species (RDD), negative dependence should be observed. However, according to another view, the number of species and structure of their abundance are determined by the different processes. The number of species is determined by the species pool size and the rate of species immigration, while the abundance structure - by the competition (Stirling, Wilsey, 2001; Ma, 2005; Wilsey, Stirling, 2007). In particular, in some communities a decrease of RDD leads to an increase in abundance of subdominant species and to oligodominant structure. These changes in relative abundance could occur without changes in species richness. Therefore these variables could be weakly related (Ma, 2005; Wilsey, Stirling, 2007; Munson, Lauenroth, 2009). However, it is unclear how widely these scenarios are realized in the plant cover. The aim of our study was to examine the relationship between RDD, the dominance structure as a whole (mono- or oligodominant), the species richness and the size of the species pool in the forest stands of the Western Caucasus. The data of forest stands were collected in the river basins of the Malaya Laba, Belaya, Sukko, Pshada, Vulan, Nebug, Agoy, Shepsi, Nauzhi, Shakhe, Sochi, Khosta, Mzymta, and some others (altitude: 10-2100 m a. s. l.). In accordance with the scheme of landscape-floristic zoning of the Western Caucasus (Zernov, 2006), the studied stands are located in Novorossiysk, Sochi and Maykop regions (Fig. 1). A significant amount of data was collected in protected areas (Caucasus Biosphere Reserve, Sochi National Park, Bolshoy Tkhach Nature Park, Maykop Botanical Reserve, and others). The sample plots (300 m2) were set in all the most widespread forest communities (altogether 685). All trees > 6.0 cm dbh were counted in each sample plot. The data were analyzed as follows: 1. types of stands were allocated according to dominant, subdominant and constant species; 2. for each plot the total number of individuals per 300 m2 (W), dominance level (RDD = W1/W where W1 - individual number of species of first rank), and number of species per plot (S) were calculated; the total number of species (N), that is the size of regional species pool (Zobel et al., 1998) was determined for each type of stands; 3. average density and constancy of species, as well as N and average S, in stands of each type with high and low RDD as well as these in the mono- and oligodominant stands were compared. Also, the relationship between species richness (S) and RDD for each community type were considered. Based on the dominant and constant species the forest stands were merged into 12 types: BL - stands dominated by Betula litwinowii (1850- 2200 m a. s. l.); ANU, ANM and ANL - Abies nordmanniana (1500-2000, 1000-1500 and 600-1000 m, respectively); FON and FOS - Fagus orientalis (on the northern (with absence of Castanea sativa, Maykop region, 400-600 m) and southern (with presence of Castanea sativa, Sochi region, 80-1000 m) macroslopes of Big Caucasian Ridge); AG and AI - Alnus glutinosa and A. incana (floodplains, 100- 800 m); QR - Quercus robur (200-350 m); PN - Pinus nigra subsp. pallasiana (30-200 m); QPS and QPN - stands with dominated by Quercus petraea and the presence (Novorossiysk region, 50-500 m) or absence (Maykop and Sochi regions, 350-1000 m) of Carpinus orientalis (Tabl. 1 and 2; Fig. 2-8). All stands with high RDD (0.68-0.92) are monodominant (Tabl. 1, Fig. 9A). The mean species diversity of stands of specific types (S) varies from 1.8 to 3.7 species per 300 m2 (Tabl. 3; Fig. 9b). The lowest species richness (1.8 species) was found in the upper-mountain fir stands (ANU) and in the low-mountain beech stands (FON); the highest - in ANL, FOS and QR (3.1-3.7 species). The stands with low RDD (0.34-0.54) in relatively severe environments are monodominant (BL, QPN and PN); in relatively favorable ones - mainly oligodominant (Tabl. 1). In forest stands with a low RDD most of species have a higher constancy than in stands with a high RDD (Tabl. 2). Therefore, the first ones are characterized mainly by higher species richness (2.6-4.8 species per 300 m2) (Tabl. 3; Fig. 9b). On average, for types of stands where the oligodominant structure is not common, it is 70 % higher. In types of communities, where such a structure is formed relatively often, on average by 29 %. Hence, there is a negative correlation between RDD and S in stands of all types (Tabl. 4). However, the Pearson' correlation coefficient in the monodominant stands in harsh habitats (BL, QPN and PN) is higher than in mono- and oligodominant stands in more favorable habitats. The total number of species recorded in stands with high and low RDD, as well as with mono- and oligominant structure is (with some exceptions) similar: 5-14 species (Tabl. 3; Fig. 9B). The smallest number of species (5-6) is in the upper-mountain birch (BL) and fir (ANU) stands; average (8-9) - in the fir stands of the upper part of the middle-mountain belt (ANM), as well as in stands on the dry slopes of the Black Sea coast (PN); the largest (10-14) - in stands of moderately warm and humid habitats (ANL, FON, FOS, QR, and others). The situation when the species community richness with high and low RDD is different, while the size of the species pool is similar, may indicate a relative independence of these parameters (Fig. 10). Thus, the species richness of forest stands of the Western Caucasus on small plots closer linked with structures of dominance, than with species pool size.

They are designed to maximize a certain biodiversity dimension such as coverage of species in the case of hotspots and complementarity, or composite properties of ecosystems in the case of wilderness. Most comparisons between approaches have ignored the multidimensionality of biodiversity. We analyze here the results of two species-based methodologies—hotspots and complementarity—and an ecosystem-based methodology—wilderness—at local scale. As zoning of protected areas can increase the effectiveness of conservation, we use the data employed for the management plan of the Peneda-Gerês National Park in Portugal. We compare the approaches against four criteria: species representativeness, wilderness coverage, coverage of important areas for megafauna, and for regulating ecosystem services. Our results suggest that species- and ecosystem-based approaches select significantly different areas at local scale. Our results also show that no approach covers well all biodiversity dimensions. Species-based approaches cover species distribution better, while the ecosystem-based approach favors wilderness, areas important for megafauna, and for ecosystem services. Management actions addressing different dimensions of biodiversity have a potential for contradictory effects, social conflict, and ecosystem services trade-offs, especially in the context of current European biodiversity policies. However, biodiversity is multidimensional, and management and zoning at local level should reflect this aspect. The consideration of both species- and ecosystem-based approaches at local scale is necessary to achieve a wider range of conservation goals. © 2015, The Author(s).","Area prioritization; Complementarity; Conservation management; Conservation planning; Protected areas; Wilderness; Zoning","Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Portugal; Wilderness; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Zoning; Complementarity; Conservation management; Conservation planning; Prioritization; Protected areas; Wilderness; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental protection; Portugal; procedures; wilderness; Ecosystems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937758876"

However, preparation and implementation process of this document was extremely varied and suffered several modifications aiming its improvement. The objective of this work was to analyze the evolution of management plans in the context of national parks management, analyzing as a concrete case its implementation in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The preparation of management plans for Brazilian parks was marked by the existence of three different methodological references that was reflected in the variety of plans identified for five national parks studied here (Itatiaia NP, Serra dos Órgãos NP, Tijuca NP, Serra da Bocaina NP and Restinga da Jurubatiba NP). As a general pattern, the plans were neither prepared nor revised with the periodicity established by the legislation. This shows a difficulty in the implementation of this instrument even almost thirty years after its institution.","Management plan; National park and Protected area","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79957718305"

In Cuba Island the studies about this resource are very scarce and particularly in the Southeastern regions of the country. With the aim to get important fishery information about this gastropod, adult Queen Conch density and frequency of reproductive activity were evaluated in Cabo Cruz, Cuba, during 2009-2010. Data from three seasons were obtained (rainy, dry and cold fronts periods) from three different areas: Farito, Guafe and Laguna. The highest density was observed in cold fronts season (468.5ind./ha) and the lowest occurred during the dry season (268.5ind./ha). The highest density was reported at Laguna (520.4ind./ha) and the lowest at Farito (290.9ind./ha). In total, 158 reproductive events were observed. The highest frequency was reported in rainy season (36%), followed by dry (9%) and cold fronts (5%) seasons. Reproductive behavior (mating and egg laying) was related to temperature and photoperiod. Reproductive activity was observed during the whole year, which suggests the existence of an important Queen Conch reserve in the Southeastern region of Cuba and an apparently self-sufficient population for recruitment. From our results we may conclude that, the population's sustainable exploitation is viable if the following management measures are observed: functional zoning within the area, rotation of fishing areas and a closed season. We recommend that the Laguna site should be protected as a reproduction zone and banned for fishing activities.","Caribbean sea; Eustrombus gigas; Fishery management; Protected areas; Reproduction evidence","Animals; Cuba; Female; Gastropoda; Male; Population Density; Reproduction; Seasons; animal; article; classification; Cuba; female; gastropod; male; physiology; population density; reproduction; season","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84877291189"

We have undertaken a detailed investigation of metagranites from the contact aureole that fringes a quartz diorite intrusion of Late Permian age, emplaced into Carboniferous peraluminous granites of the Gennargentu Igneous Complex (Sardinia, Italy). New data are presented including the petrography of metagranites within a 500 m zone adjacent to the quartz diorite intrusion, the compositions of minerals and bulk-rocks, and the oxygen isotope compositions of separated minerals. We have used these data to assess the mobility of elements, expressed as δoxide, in the aureole, and the physical conditions of fluid-assisted thermometamorphism. Modal variations and the oscillatory zoning of plagioclase demonstrate that the shallow (P ≤200MPa) quartz diorite intrusion was emplaced through a number of magmatic injections. The border zone of the quartz diorite intrusion presents evidence of two main processes: hybridization between andesite and rhyolite magmas and volatile saturation of the mingled magma. Modal differences in the contact zone with respect to the protolith (i.e. peraluminous granite), variations in mineral composition, temperature constraints and δK2O, δNa2O, δSiO2 and δAl2O3 indicate that a relatively large volume of the host granite (up to 400 m from the contact) was metasomatized by high-temperature (650-350°C) fluids derived from the mingled zone of the quartz diorite intrusion. In detail, the metasomatic K2O-rich fluid reacted with albite to form K-feldspar, and triggered the recrystallization of quartz and plagioclase to higher calcium concentrations. The progressive increase in the MgO/(MgO+FeO) of chlorite closer to the contact indicates that this phase also recrystallized. The iron released during chlorite recrystallization was buffered by hematite formation in the pores of metasomatic K-feldspar. The Gennargentu metagranites provide evidence that metasomatic fluids can play a major role in driving metamorphic reactions in contact aureoles. For instance, the expected increase of Ca in plagioclase owing to thermal equilibration was not achieved in the high-T zone of the aureole because of fluid-assisted removal of cations. We conclude that caution should be taken when interpreting the processes that underpin contact metamorphism in terms of thermally driven, ionic diffusion alone, because the role of fluids may be significant, if not overwhelming, in the domains closest to the magmatic source. © The Author 2013.

In the course of time their function has been redefined and re-orientated towards nature conservation, thus playing an important role in the concept of sustainable development. The protection of ecosystems now enjoys top priority in all the official activities. This includes the creation of a system of terrestrial parks that will incorporate all 39 defined natural regions of Canada. Since 1990 this goal has been pursued very energetically. In 1995 there were more than 15 million visitors to Canada's national parts, representing a growth of 23% since 1989. They tended to visit the older parks that were conceived under the old principles. Hence management planning, in particular zoning, will serve to minimize the negative side-effects of tourism. In addition to their recreational and conservational function, national parks have the very important function of educating the public. National parks are making an important contribution to creating responsible attitudes towards the environment, even beyond their boundaries.","","Canada; environmental management; national park; nature conservation; tourism","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031767608"

The Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) established a network of coastal NTZs in 2001, yet, to date no study has investigated their effectiveness in protecting and enabling key species to recover. Using data from the Galapagos National Park Directorate annual Lobster Population Monitoring Program from 2012 to 2014, this study evaluated the recovery of the commercially valuable red spiny lobster (Panulirus penicillatus) inside NTZs in the GMR. It was hypothesized that NTZs would present higher lobster abundances or sizes when compared with adjacent fished zones. However, the study found no significant differences in these comparisons. Overall the findings indicate that > 11 years of protection has had no appreciable effect on lobster abundances or sizes inside the NTZs. This paper explores possible reasons for the lack of response in NTZs, and concluded that non-compliance and shortcomings within the enforcement framework of the GMR are the key factors limiting the functionality of these NTZs. Additionally, it also evaluates the limitations of the current monitoring program and highlights the need for a more comprehensive and long-term program to be implemented. As the new zoning scheme for NTZs in the GMR that began in 2016 is still to be determined, this information should be considered by decision makers to improve the effectiveness of NTZs and sustainable management of the GRM's coastal resources. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","","Ecuador; Galapagos Islands; Galapagos Marine Reserve; Palinuridae; Panulirus penicillatus; coastal zone management; environmental assessment; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; lobster; marine resource; stakeholder; sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037055308"

Within these parks, invasive species are second only to habitat destruction as the cause of biodiversity loss and ecological damage. So in January 2007 when a park volunteer discovered the invasive quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) in Lake Mead, which is part of the Lake Mead Recreation Area, the National Park Service (NPS) unit responsible for managing the recreation area was prepared for just such a discovery. It had an early detection program in place and had a clear operational mandate to do something about an invasion if it occurred. Upon finding mussels, the NPS quickly moved to access funding and the best available science to implement a response. After debating four options, the NPS focused on education and enforcing existing laws to prevent mussel spread. Despite this reasonable preparation and response, quagga mussels spread throughout the park, and quagga colonies soon began to appear throughout the southwestern United States. Given that efforts to stem the invasion were reasonable and rapid, why did they fail? While it is not known if any management strategy would have prevented or stopped the spread of mussels, the NPS was clearly constrained by an underlying commitment to manage the park by “zones.” This use of zoning as a management strategy concentrated visitation in the recreation area onto two lakes (Lakes Mead and Mohave), which in turn opened a pathway for invasion, guided management decisions, and likely contributed to the rapid spread of quagga mussels. Traditional policy efforts in conservation focus on what to conserve and where. However, very little information exists as to what policies actually work in the field. Failure to evaluate how policies translate into actions has led to the adoption of dogma that can be wrong and to an unwavering faith in the connection between a policy directive (e.g., ecotourism, bioprospecting, zoning) and a conservation outcome. Zoning is a common practice in park units worldwide. It reduces traditional stressors on other parts of a park by concentrating the human footprint in one area and reconciles competing mandates to protect nature and allow recreation. However, it also concentrates pathways for invasion by nonindigenous species. The risk of invasion by these species requires that the traditional management approach by zoning be examined and possibly be replaced by a more dynamic approach, particularly in susceptible parks like the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054458050"

These zoning data are used to infer crystal residence times, magma mixing, and other magmatic processes in many magmatic systems. We present the shared characteristic diagram (SCD) as an organizational framework for crystal zoning data that compares information from different phases and chemical tracers in a common framework. An example from Chaos Crags in the Cascade arc, produces three main results. (1) Anorthite zoning profiles in plagioclase have fewer shared characteristics in mafic inclusions than in the host rhyodacite. (2) Single-crystal 87Sr/86Sr data from previous studies (Tepley et al. 1999) are consistent with more shared history between crystals than in anorthite profiles. This difference reflects a more homogeneous distribution of 87Sr/86Sr than the intensive parameters controlling plagioclase composition. (3) The Chaos Crags system exhibits a layer of heterogeneity in crystal populations that is not represented in whole-rock analyses that indicate only simple binary mixing. The inconsistency between 87Sr/86Sr and anorthite zoning data highlights decoupling between compositionally controlled and temperature/water-controlled zoning in plagioclase from Chaos Crags. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","","California; Lassen Volcanic National Park; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; crystallization; isotopic composition; magma; mixing; texture; trace element","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-23844520678"

Illegal logging and other unwanted encroachments to the park become a big problem, as national park authority has a limited capacity to monitor the whole park. This research aimed to study how local communities viewed Gunung Palung National Park, which is located in Ketapang and Kayong Utara District, West Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. A total of 91 respondents from seven villages were interviewed. In general, about 70% of respondents viewed the importance of economic benefits, resulting from limited access to traditional gardens in the use zone of the park and the supply of clean water. Approximately 67% of these respondents viewed the protection of natural resources in the park was not important. This view was possibly due to their little knowledge of the park management and the use of zoning system in the park. It was reported that park officers have some activities, but the collaboration and relationship between park officers and local communities need more time to mature. It seems that the poor and the youth tend to exploit more and put higher pressures on the park than the elderly groups. © 2018 Biodiversitas.

This variety of granodiorite typifies intermediate-age hornblende-phyric units of Cretaceous nested plutonic suites in the Sierra Nevada batholith. Although only inclusions of feldspar are evident in hand samples, the phenocrysts are riddled with up to 50% inclusions of every major mineral found in the host granodiorite plus metamorphic minerals formed during cooling. Amphibole compositions within single phenocrysts vary from actinolite with less than 1 wt% Al2O3 to magnesiohornblende with over 8 wt%. Elemental zoning within the amphibole is highly irregular on the micrometer scale, showing patches and polygonal zones with dramatically different compositions separated by sharp to gradual transitions. The chemical compositions of entire phenocrysts are equivalent to hornblende plus a small proportion of biotite, suggesting that the non-biotite inclusions are the result of metamorphism of the phenocrysts. Backscattered electron imaging shows evidence of brecciation that may have been the result of volume changes as hornblende was converted to actinolite. Pressure calculations using the Al-in-hornblende barometer show unreasonably wide variations on the micrometer scale that cannot have been produced by temperature or pressure variations during crystallization. These hornblende phenocrysts would thus be unsuitable for geobarometry, and caution must be used to avoid similarly zoned phenocrysts in the application of the Al-in-hornblende geobarometer. © 2017 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston 2017.","amphibole; barometry; hornblende; Igneous petrology; incremental emplacement; metamorphic petrology; mineralogy; thermal cycling","California; United States; Yosemite National Park; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Barometers; Biotite; Feldspar; Forestry; Gasoline; Mica; Micrometers; Mineralogy; Petrology; Rocks; Thermal cycling; amphibole; Amphibole compositions; Backscattered electron imaging; Barometry; hornblende; Incremental emplacement; Sierra Nevada batholith; Yosemite National Park; barometry; emplacement; granodiorite; greenschist facies; hornblende; metamorphism; mineralogy; petrology; phenocryst; Domes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85012249339"

We used 786 artificial nests baited with quail eggs to examine the effect of habitat alteration on nest predation in Lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi. Natural forest and four habitats of forest margin areas: forest edge, forest gardens, coffee plantations, and secondary forest, were studied. Two types of artificial nests, ground and shrub nests were placed in these habitats at two different locations for a period of 8 days. In addition, we used automatic cameras and cage-traps to identify the predators. Nests in shrubs experienced significantly higher predation rates in forest margin areas than in natural forest. Predation on ground nests did not differ significantly between these habitat types, but was significantly higher than that on shrub nests in each habitat except forest edge. Rodents were the most common predators of both nests, but shrub nests were also susceptible to Dwarf cuscus (Strigocuscus celebensis), squirrels, and tree snakes. The nest predation rates we found were among the highest found in tropical rainforests, probably a consequence of the unique predator assemblages of Sulawesi. These results suggest that egg survival is negatively affected by human intervention and that human-induced habitats might have only limited importance for the conservation of Sulawesi's largely endemic understorey avifauna. These considerations might be important since forest margins comprise significant proportions of protected areas on Sulawesi and play an important role in future Park zoning concepts as well as in conservation-oriented land use management. © 2006 Springer.","Central Sulawesi; Conservation; Edge effects; Forest margin habitats; Indonesia; Nest predation","Asia; Central Sulawesi; Eurasia; Indonesia; Lore Lindu National Park; Southeast Asia; Aves; Phasianidae; Rodentia; Sciuridae; Serpentes; Strigocuscus celebensis; artificial nest; bait; coffee; forest ecosystem; forest edge; forest garden; habitat conservation; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; habitat type; national park; nest predation; plantation; secondary forest","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33845466930"

Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) have been used to evaluate conflicts between approved uses and actual uses in La Restinga Lagoon National Park in Venezuela (LRLNP). The park (188.6 km 2), covers various ecosystems such as coastal lagoons, marine waters and xerophytic vegetation, it is visited by up to 260,000 people visit per year. A GIS, using a base map compiled from 1:25,000 maps was developed. Natural cover was mapped from LANDSAT VII TM images, orthophotomaps and aerial photographs. Spatial use data was collected by field GPS location of any use inside the park during 2 years. Thematic vector maps for each land cover, zoning area, and observed use were created. Maps of zoning and uses were overlapped and new maps for each use-zoning crossing were created. The park contain nine different zoning areas wherein 28 different uses were identified, 18 of them were direct consumptive and non-consumptive uses, occurring on 54% of the park. Tourism transit areas were the most used zones. More than 5,000 people use the park during a high season day. Superimposition of zoning maps with actual use data produced 13 uses taking place in not allowed areas (46% of park area). Most common prohibited use was commercial net fishing, occurring in nearly 40% of the park area. Therefore, identifying human use conflicts and its geographical distribution is a key issue to improve Management Plans as well as identifying hot sites.

To ensure the long-term dune management sustainability, the linear functional zoning approach must replace the current perpendicular one in the management of the national parks of Kurshskaya kosa and Kursi K nerija. The shifting dune management should be based on the interpretation of the Curonian Spit as an interrelated system of linear littoral habitats. This interrelated system of the linear littoral habitats comprises the ridge of shifting barchans together with the adjacent windward strips of kupstyne and palve. The management should focus on facilitating the dynamism of palve by promoting responsible tourism there.","Curonian spit; Forest proliferation; Linear littoral habitats; Shifting dunes","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859068928"

To inform future research and policy decisions, we reviewed the scientific literature to assess MPA impacts on five indicators of human welfare: food security, resource rights, employment, community organization, and income. Following MPA establishment, food security generally remained stable or increased in older and smaller MPAs. The ability of most fishing groups to govern MPA resources changed. Increased resource rights were positively correlated with MPA zoning and compliance with MPA regulations. Small sample sizes precluded statistical tests of the impacts of MPAs on employment, community organization, and income. Our results demonstrate that MPAs shape the social well-being and political power of fishing communities; impacts (positive and negative) vary within and among social groups; and social impacts are correlated with some-but not all-commonly hypothesized explanatory factors. Accordingly, MPAs may represent a viable strategy for enhancing food security and empowering local communities, but current practices negatively affect at least a minority of fishers.

The aim of this study was to establish whether herbivores impact recruitment in populations of the species. In particular, we want to compare the herbivore effect in non-protected populations with protected populations inside a national park. We compared demographic features and the regeneration process in four populations, two located inside and two outside the park. We expect populations inside the park to exhibit a significantly greater recruitment, expressed in seedling establishment and survival, relative to those outside the park. Outside the park, livestock predation on fruits and herbivory on seedlings could hamper recruitment. However, fruit and seedling predation was similarly high both inside and outside the park, posing a significant constraint on the regeneration of B. miersii. The main associated causes were the presence of livestock and seedling desiccation. If the survival of B. miersii is to be achieved, managing livestock pressure, possibly through zoning, seems mandatory. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Beilschmiedia miersii; Chile; Herbivory; Protected areas; Seedling establishment","Chile; conservation status; endangered species; herbivory; introduced species; regeneration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035111057"

The management of these landscape units can reduce conflicts caused by human activities. Tandoreh National Park is one of the most biologically diverse, protected areas in Iran. Although the area is generally designed to protect biodiversity, there are many conflicts between biodiversity conservation and human activities. For instance, the area is highly controversial and has been considered as an impediment to local economic development, such as tourism, grazing, road construction, and cultivation. In order to reduce human conflicts with biodiversity conservation in Tandoreh National Park, safe zones need to be established and human activities need to be moved out of the zones. In this study we used a systematic methodology to integrate a participatory process with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using a multi–criteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique to guide a zoning scheme for the Tandoreh National Park, Iran. Our results show that the northern and eastern parts of the Tandoreh National Park that were close to rural areas and farmlands returned less desirability for selection as a preservation area. Rocky Mountains were the most important and most destructed areas and abandoned plains were the least important criteria for preservation in the area. Furthermore, the results reveal that the land properties were considered to be important for protection based on the obtained preservation zone. However, these parts are not fully covered under the current protection plans for the area. © 2016 Museu de Ciències Naturals de Barcelona.","MCDA; Preservation zone; Tandoreh national park; Zoning","Iran; biodiversity; decision analysis; GIS; multicriteria analysis; national park; participatory approach; zoning system","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961243833"

Improved documentation of these fisheries is needed to gauge global trends, identify the threats to their sustainability, and assess management options. Combining semi-structured interviews and participant observation, this study provides baseline information about the nature and scale of small-scale fisheries in the Ko Chang archipelago, Thailand, as a first step towards instituting a monitoring and management strategy for the area. Although the area has been designated as a ""no-take"" Marine National Park, small-scale fisheries have continued virtually unabated within the park's boundaries. Small-scale fishers living in the park are involved primarily in the shrimp trammel net, squid trap, crab trap, fish gill net, hook-and-line, and reef fish trap fisheries. Small-scale fishing boats operating out of villages on Ko Chang and Ko Maisi Yai worked for an estimated 38,000 days/year and took 330,000 kg/year of target fish and invertebrates, based on extrapolations from interviews. Observed catches of target species were, however, an average of 42-64% lower than fishers' reported catches for the fisheries in which both data collection methods could be used. Such a finding suggests that future monitoring should rely on observational techniques to assess the catches and efforts of small-scale participants. Given the area's status as a national park, regular monitoring of the small-scale fisheries should be undertaken and multiple-use zoning be considered. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Delimitation, zoning and governance structures are some of the environmental management tools that are provided by MPAs. These management tools may be contentious when human settlements exist within an MPAs’ boundaries, since zoning affects existing human activities and potential developments, and managing structures overlap traditional governance arrangements. Varying perspectives emerge when each stakeholder is taken into consideration separately. Ideally all stakeholders with genuine interests in MPAs should take part in the delimitation, zoning and governance of these areas. However, governance is about reaching agreements amidst differences and is not just a matter of considering differences as singularities. In order to understand how multiple stakeholders would reach a shared environmental governance of an MPA, we took the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park (ECLSP) in The Bahamas as a case study. The ECLSP, created in 1958, is co-managed by the Government of The Bahamas and the Bahamas National Trust (BNT), and contains within its boundaries uninhabited islands, islands occupied by local communities, and private islands mainly owned by foreigners or held in Bahamian trusts. In this study, we conducted an exercise with different stakeholders who were challenged to work together in redrawing the park’s boundaries, zoning and governance structures. Their individual opinions mattered less than the discussion and outcomes of their joint work. We conclude that a shared environmental governance structure does not eliminate all the frictions among stakeholders, but rather it makes them all aware of the natural and social complexities involved in managing MPAs, which improves stewardship and enhances the ECLSP’s legitimacy among stakeholders. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bahamas; Governance; Marine national parks; Participatory process","Bahamas; environmental management; governance approach; human activity; local participation; marine environment; marine park; stakeholder; urban development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013418924"

It is gazetted as vulnerable under Western Australian legislation and requires active management to ensure its survival. Translocating species to areas of suitable habitat, when coupled with predator control, is an effective method of expanding species distribution as well as increasing population numbers. This study investigated the requirements for both effective translocation and site assessment in relation to the development of tourism based on black-flanked rock-wallabies. A species-specific habitat ranking system was devised to identify suitable areas for translocated populations. This was followed by an assessment of the tourism potential of the identified sites. When both sets of results were added together potential sites were identified that could satisfy both habitat and tourism requirements. Avon Valley National Park and Billyacatting Nature Reserve were found to be the most suitable sites for translocating rock-wallabies on the basis of suitable habitat and the potential for subsequent development of wildlife tourism. Viable breeding population size, feral predator control, competing introduced herbivore control and fire management are all identified as aspects that require management action. Tourism management requires stakeholder liaison, possible zoning and separation strategies and appropriate waste disposal at tourism sites. Public contact with translocated animals requires an educative approach that avoids any feeding of wildlife. Relatively close contact between visitors and wildlife may be achieved through a process of habituation. Such strategies should however be subject to review.","Black-flanked rock-wallaby; Habitat ranking; Tourism potential; Translocations; Wildlife management","Australasia; Australia; Western Australia; Animalia; Petrogale; Petrogale lateralis lateralis; assessment method; breeding population; conservation management; ecotourism; habitat use; isolated population; mammal; nature reserve; population distribution; species conservation; stakeholder; tourism development; tourism management; translocation; waste disposal; wildlife management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-36148959679"

Vertical zoning of salt distribution on natural outcrops differs from the salt distribution in masonry. Salt distribution near the base of the cliff (profile to about 2-2.5 m above the ground) is affected by capillary rise from the ground level (first maximum of water-soluble salts at the level of 1-1.5 m above the ground) and by percolation of precipitation through the overhanging rock sequence (second maximum of 2-2.5 m above the ground). Percolation of salt solution from higher parts is affected by the asperity of the rock surface. The concentration of salts (determined by ion exchange chromatography) correlates to the changes of physical properties: bulk porosity, microporosity and water absorption.

Channel areas between islands were severely damaged. Areas with steep reef slopes were damaged by sand slides or coral collapse more than areas with low slopes. Massive, sub-massive, and encrusting corals were more resistant and resilient to the direct impact of the tsunami than branching, tabulate, and foliose life forms whereas the latter were more tolerant of temporary coverage by sand. Sub-massive corals were the most tolerant overall and survived sand coverage, breakage, and overturning. Live coral cover measured three months after the tsunami was significantly greater than immediately post-tsunami as broken, moved, or sand-covered corals, recorded as impacted in the initial survey, had survived and were regenerating. Low turbidity, lack of pollution, and mild currents possibly contributed to rapid recovery and limited long-term effects of the tsunami. Impact assessment shortly after a major disturbance may give an initial measure of damage but subsequent surveys must be undertaken to identify long-term effects. Understanding patterns of reef damage can help to formulate reef zoning and protection strategies in response to catastrophic events, but also in advance of such events to improve likely resilience of the marine park to disturbance.","Coral reef; Environmental impact; Management response; Surin Marine National Park; Tsunami","Asia; Eurasia; Northeastern Region; Southeast Asia; Surin; Thailand; Anthozoa; Coastal zones; Environmental impact; Reefs; Shore protection; Strategic planning; coral reef; environmental impact; marine park; tsunami; Management response; Marine park; Thailand; Tsunamis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34147129177"

Therefore, the red line has played an important role in the field of ecological protection, not only optimizing ecological security but also relating resource protection to economic development. Most importantly, it is a bottom line for China’s construction of an ecologically sustainable civilization. In the initial stages, ecological red line protection meant a strictly administered strategic border for the maintenance of national and regional ecological security and economic and social sustainable development. The early development of natural resource conservation concepts and policy saw similar methods and practices at home and abroad. Foreign countries commonly use national park systems, special protection areas (SPAs), special areas of conservation, Natura 2000, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature-Global Protected Areas to protect ecological spaces. China has generally used nature reserves, country parks, basic ecological control lines, and national zoning of ecological and subjective functions to achieve the same ends. Among these, the extensively used basic ecological control line is regarded as the prototype for the ecological red line. After the proposal of the red line concept, Jiangsu Province was the first to officially implement the concept in China. In this year's annual Local NPC and CPPCC, the ecological red line has been incorporated into the work reports of many provincial governments, showing that drawing the red line has entered the strategic promotion phase. With the progress study, the concept of the ecological red line has been extended to a comprehensive system covering three aspects:space, resources, and quality of environment. Based on relevant literature and the relationships between production, life, and ecological space, the foundation of its theory extensions comes from the theory of ecological risk source of regional development established by Ren Jingming et al., including the ecological footprint, resource consumption and pollution emissions accumulated three types. The ecological red line is extending into ecological space, resource consumption, and environmental protection, and further proposes to control requirements, including the warning to the top line, the regulation to the midline, and the maintenance of the bottom line. Meanwhile, the system of ecological red lines is implemented based on a case study of the Ningde region. The results showed that the total area enclosed within an ecological red line is 4258.03 km2, accounting for 31.65% of the total land area of Ningde. The red line of resource consumption and environmental protection is the concrete implementation of control requirements, and formed red indicators. Finally, a supporting safeguard mechanism will be established from three aspects (regulations, systems, and markets) in order to provide a reference for further improvements of the red line system. © 2015 Ecological Society of China.

We compared the resulting models with both records of activities provided by park authorities, and information on distribution of fishing zones obtained from a workshop with fishermen. We found the models consistent with the actual uses within the system.

Comparisons of petrographic and compositional data for these dikes and alaskite with published data for Sierra Nevada plutons lead us to suggest that mafic magmas were important in the generation of the Sierra Nevada batholith. Specifically, we conclude that: (1) intrusion of mafic magmas in the lower crust caused partial melting and generation of alaskite (rhyolitic) magmas; (2) interaction between the mafic and felsic magmas lead to the observed linear variation diagrams for major elements; (3) most mafic inclusions in Sierra Nevada plutons represent chilled pillows of mafic magmas, related by fractional crystallization and granitoid assimilation, that dissolve into their felsic host and contaminate it to intermediate (granodioritic) compositions; (4) vesiculation of hydrous mafic magma upon chilling may allow buoyant mafic inclusions and their disaggregation products to collect beneath a pluton's domed ceiling causing the zoning (mafic margins-to-felsic core) that these plutons exhibit. © 1983.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021089709"

Three discrete periods of ash-fall at Kodiak correlate, respectively, with Plinian tephra layers designated A, CD, and FG by Curtis (1968) in the VTTS. The ash-flow sequence overlapped with but outlasted pumice fall A, terminating within 20 hours of the initial outbreak and prior to pumice fall C. Layers E and H consist mostly of vitric dust that settled during lulls, and Layer B is the feather edge of the ash flow. The fall units filled and obscured the caldera, but arcuate and radial fissures outline a 6-km2 depression. The Novarupta lava dome and its ejecta ring were emplaced later within the depression. At Mt. Katmai, 10 km east of the 1912 vent, a 600-m-deep caldera of similar area also collapsed at about this time, probably owing to hydraulic connection with the venting magma system; but all known ejecta are thought to have erupted at Novarupta. Mingling of three distinctive magmas during the eruption produced an abundance of banded pumice, and mechanical mixing of chilled ejecta resulted in deposits with a wide range of bulk composition. Pumice in the initial fall unit (A) is 100% rhyolite, but fall units atop the ash flow are > 98% dacite; black andesitic scoria is common only in the ash flows and in near-vent air-fall tephra. Pumice counts show the first half of the ash-flow deposit to be 91-98% rhyolite, but progressive increases of dacite and andesite eventually reduced the rhyolitic component to < 2%. The later, rhyolite-poor flows were hotter, less mobile, and widely produced partially welded tuff and vapor-indurated sillar. The main ash flow was too deflated and sluggish 16 km from the vent to surmount a 25-m-high moraine in its path but was diverted around it and continued 5 km down-valley, engulfing and charring trees but not toppling all of them. Thin ash-flow veneers feather 30-40 m up the enclosing valley walls but only where a constriction in the central VTTS locally raised the flow level. In the upper VTTS, the ""high sand mark"" is not a veneer but a marginal bench formed in thick tuff by differential compaction. Flooding from adjacent glaciers led to phreatic explosions that ejected blocks of tuff more welded than any yet exposed. A cluster of phreatic craters dammed a lake atop the tuff, the breaching of which caused a flood that scoured the ash-flow surface in the central VTTS, transported 50-cm blocks of welded tuff > 20 km to the lowermost VTTS, and deposited 1-8 m of debris there. Rhyolitic ejecta contain only 1-2% phenocrysts but andesite and dacite have 30-45%. Quartz is present and augite absent only in the rhyolite, but all ejecta contain plagioclase, orthopyroxene, titanomagnetite, ilmenite, apatite, and pyrrhotite; rare olivine occurs in the andesite. The zoning ranges of phenocrysts in the rhyolitic and intermediate ejecta do not overlap. New chemical data show the bulk SiO2 range to be: rhyolite 77 ± 0.6, dacite 66-64.5, and andesite 61.5-58.5%. The dacitic and andesitic ejecta contrast in color and density, and it is not certain whether they form a compositional continuum. Analyses reported by Fenner within the 66-76% SiO2 range were of banded pumice and lava and of bulk tephra that mechanically fractionated and mixed during flight. Despite the gap of 10% SiO2, Fe-Ti-oxide temperatures show a continuous range from rhyolite (805-850°C) through dacite (855-955°C) to andesite (955-990°C). Thermal continuity and isotopic and trace-element data suggest that all were derived from a single magmatic system, whether or not they were physically contiguous before eruption. If the rhyolitic liquid separated from dacitic magma, extraction was so efficient that no dacitic phenocrysts were retained and no bulk compositions in the range 66-76% SiO2 were created; if it were a partial melt of roof rocks atop an intermediate magma body, then such rocks had no O- or Sr-isotopic contrast with the andesite-dacite magma and clearly did not include the Jurassic arkosic or granitic basement. The presence of Holocene domes of pre-1912 glassy dacite adjacent to the 1912 vent suggest that the 7 km3 (or more) of high-silica rhyolitic magma (a composition rare in the Aleutian arc) was generated in less than a few thousand years. The 1912 vent is semi-encircled by several andesitic stratocones and is as close to Mageik, Trident, and Griggs volcanoes as it is to Mt. Katmai. The erupted magma probably occupied only shallow levels of an extensive system of injection and storage under a cluster of several stratovolcanoes. Although Quaternary basalt is not known to have erupted here, the intrusion of basaltic magma probably sustains the greater-VTTS magmatic system. © 1983.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021086318"

The natural features of Kruger National Park, which form the basis of such an ecological planning exercise and from which the various land use categories, values, and zoning classes can be determined, are discussed in detail. The suitability of each of the various features is analyzed and a final zoning proposal for Kruger National Park is suggested. Furthermore a method for selecting a site for a new camp is illustrated by referring to the site for the new Mopane rest camp which is now under construction in the Kruger National Park. The conclusion is reached that the proposed ecological planning model can be used successfully in planning conservation areas such as Kruger National Park and for the selection of the most desirable sites for the establishment of new rest camps. Its suitability as a practical model in such planning exercises is proven by the fact that the siting proposals of two new camps based on this model have been accepted by the National Parks Board, the controlling body of Kruger National Park. © 1990 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.","Camp siting; Conservation; Ecology; Land use; Planning; Zoning","South Africa, Kruger National Park; campsite; conservation area; ecological planning; final zoning; planning proposal; rest camp; site selection; article; ecology; environmental planning; model; organization and management; south africa","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025196932"

In Austria the Hohe Tauern National Park represents a high mountain area which combines a diversified alpine landscape and ecosystem with the century-old traditions of local population. Based on initiatives beginning in 1971 to establish the Hohe Tauern National Park, between 1983 and 1991 the Länder of Carinthia, Salzburg, and Tyrol worked together and gradually enlarged the Park to a non-contiguous area of 1,800 km2 which includes a total of 29 communities. In an attempt to conserve nature, preserve traditional living space, and promote tourism, the National Park area was subdivided into a high alpine core zone of largely unspoiled nature and an outer zone which includes landscapes modified by human impact. Zoning has been introduced to foster interrelationships and interaction between wilderness areas and adjacent seminatural cultural landscapes. The fifteen-year old history of the Park has been marked by a series of diverse goals and potential land-use conflicts which required the active involvement of the local population into the planning process of the National Park. This partnership approach, which resulted in a so-called 'eco-realism' compromise, has reversed the initial widespread rejection of the park concept and won the approval of the local population.","","Austria, Hohe Tauern; conservation planning; land use planning; living space; local participation; nature conservation; tourism development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029669731"

The growth in numbers of protected areas was slow until after World War II, when most of the present national parks and reserves were established. Environmental changes detrimental to wildlife have been especially severe during the last 40 years. Some statistics are presented and the consequences for wildlife listed. In recent years public concern and interest in the rural environment has increased although this has also led to many more visitors to protected areas. Uncontrolled public use can cause damage to fragile vegetation and disturbance to animal life may interfere with breeding success. Multiple use of national parks and other protected areas for wildlife protection and public recreation requires careful control. Zoning is used to separate the two functions but in general it is better to create areas primarily for wildlife and others for public recreation. The importance of the voluntary conservation organisations is stressed: they are independent of government policy but act as advisers on the selection of state reserves as well as establishing their own. The importance of preparing a Management Plan is stressed, research needs are discussed and some priority subjects listed. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Land use; Nature conservation; Wildlife","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954931802"

This is desirable so that visitors to the camp will be provided not only with facilities for resting, eating, and sleeping, but also be able to enjoy and study the natural environment in a relaxed atmosphere. The Berg-en-Dal rest camp, which was established in Kruger National Park, was planned in such a way and designed according to the principles outlined by the authors in a companion article. The planning included six zones: a control zone, day visitor zone, overnight visitor zone, staff accommodation zone, recreation zone, and service zone. The point is stressed that plant species selected to be used as additional vegetation to those already growing in the camp were endemic to the nine landscape facets identified in the camp. The design allowed for separation of the various land-use zones in such a way that they would complement each other rather than be a hindrance to each other. The camp has been built according to the plans included in this article and has proved to be a great success. The conclusion is drawn that the planning principles are sound and should be used in the future for the planning and design of rest camps for conservation areas in South Africa. © 1990 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.","Ecology; Landscape facets; Natural Resources; Planning; Rest camp; Zoning","South Africa, Kruger National Park, Berg-en-Dal; conservation area; ecological principle; environmental characteristics; land-use zone; natural ecology; planning principle; plant ecology; rest camp; site selection; zoning practice; article; ecology; environmental planning; land use; organization and management; south africa","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025196936"

The granitoid units that make up the sequence are progressively younger and more felsic inward. The bulk of the rocks are granodiorite, but the outermost formation is quartz diorite, and the innermost one is granite porphyry. The compositional gradient changes both gradually within formations and abruptly between them. The change is greatest in the outer 1 km and lower toward the center of the sequence. Hornblende and biotite, abundant in the marginal rocks, decrease rapidly inward for 1 km as K-feldspar and quartz increase, but farther inward, they decrease slowly. The most conspicuous chemical changes are shown by the elements that are enriched in the mafic minerals. The compositional zoning indicates that with decreasing temperature, the sequence solidified from the margins inward. Solidification was interrupted repeatedly by surges of fluid core magma. The magma eroded the adjacent solidifying rock, and it expanded the area of the magma chamber at the exposed level by crowding the wall and roof rocks outward and upward and by breaking through the solidifying carapace into the wall rocks. The compositional zonation resulted from crystal fractionation that could have involved (1) preferential accretion of crystalline material present in the magma to the margins of the magma chamber, thus displacing the melt phase progressively inward, and/or (2) downward settling of crystals, probably accompanied by upward movement of melt and volatiles; the residual magma solidifying to form the granitoids. Although either mechanism can explain the observed relations, they lead to very different interpretations of the composition of the magma when the first exposed granitoids solidified at the margins of the magma chamber and as the sequence solidified inward. © 1979 Geological Society of America.","","California; United States; Yosemite National Park; Crystalline materials; Feldspar; Forestry; Mica; Quartz; Solidification; Zoning; Chemical change; Compositional gradients; Compositional zonation; Compositional zoning; Crystal fractionation; Sierra Nevada batholith; Upward movement; Yosemite National Park; batholith; crystallization; fractionation; granitoid; granodiorite; magma chamber; pluton; solidification; Rocks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0001606919"
