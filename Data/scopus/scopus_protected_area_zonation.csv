At each beach, the intertidal zone was divided into five strata from low to high tide level. In each stratum, sediment samples (corer area: 20.2 cm2, diameter: 5.07 cm) were collected to analyze the macrofauna. Additionally, grain size composition, total organic matter and carbonates of the sediments were determined. The macrofauna diversity was higher in the Pacific coast (15 taxa, per beach) than in the Caribbean (4 taxa, per beach). The most diverse taxon group was the annelids, followed by arthropods and mollusks. Within the mollusks, the bivalves and the gastropod family Olivellidae were only present in the Pacific coast. Both Caribbean and Pacific coasts had a vertical zonation of taxa distribution from high to low tide level. Typically, the low tide level was populated by several polychaetes, mid littoral by crustacean and mollusks, and the high tidal level was populated by isopods (Cirolanidae). Faunal differences in richness, abundance and composition of assemblages between both coasts can be explained by environmental differences. The tidal range is narrower on the Caribbean (0.5–1.5 m) than the Pacific coast (2–3 m). The slope of the beach is steep in several beaches of the Caribbean, whereas the Pacific has several dissipative beaches with gentle (or flat) slopes. The organic matter was lower (1.00%) in the Caribbean than in the Pacific (2.25%). In the Caribbean coast, the sediment is ∼90% fine sand (500–63 μm), while in the Pacific this fraction was ∼65%, resulting in more heterogeneous sediments in the Pacific. Finally, evidence of change in the abundance and species composition with the latitude in each coast was detected; indicating that these communities are highly variable within a local scale, which could be due to the diversity of sandy beaches and environmental variation that Costa Rica has in both coasts. Our results indicate that beaches with higher number of species or abundance were not necessarily designated as Marine Protected Areas. This information should be considered in the future for the establishment of new Marine Protected Areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal zone; Community ecology; Environmental factors; Intertidal invertebrates; Tropical beaches","Caribbean Islands; Costa Rica; Pacific Coast [Costa Rica]; Annelida; Arthropoda; Bivalvia; Cirolanidae; Costa (ostracode); Crustacea; Gastropoda; Invertebrata; Isopoda; Mollusca; Polychaeta; beach; coastal zone; community ecology; comparative study; ecological approach; environmental factor; fauna; intertidal community; invertebrate; marine ecosystem; protected area; species diversity; tropical environment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064907997"

Although research efforts have been mounting to try and identify the drivers of CWC distributions, progress has been limited by the scarcity of ecological data. The present work employs habitat suitability models (HSMs) to estimate spatial distributions, environmental drivers and co-existence patterns of 14 habitat-forming CWCs in the Azores, an area considered a hotspot of coral diversity in the Atlantic. The modelled CWCs showed a strong bathymetric zonation, which seems to be determined by the vertical stratification of water masses in the region. In particular, the modelled CWCs can be clustered in four groups named after the isopycnal (vertical) layers in which Atlantic water masses are organized: species restricted to upper water masses, species extending down from upper water masses, species restricted to intermediate water masses and species extending up from deep water masses. Horizontal patterns further indicate that the Azores Current and different production regimes north and south of the archipelago likely influence the distribution of CWCs in sub-surface waters. Such results have important implications for the regional management of deep-sea benthic communities and, in particular, for the design of representative networks of protected areas. The combined habitat of all modelled species covered only 11%. Given that they all possess the characteristics of benthic foundation organisms and represent indicator taxa of vulnerable marine ecosystems all the modelled species should be viewed as important targets for conservation. The lace coral Errina dabneyi deserves particular attention since this species appears to be endemic to the Azores and has a very limited estimated distribution. © 2023 The Authors","Azores; Cold-water corals; Deep sea; Foundation species; Vulnerable marine ecosystems; Water masses","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Azores Current; Ecosystems; Oceanography; Population distribution; Surface waters; Azore; Benthic communities; Co-existence; Cold-water corals; Deep sea; Ecological data; Foundation species; Research efforts; Vulnerable marine ecosystem; Water mass; archipelago; benthos; coexistence; coral; deep water; deep-sea organism; ecological modeling; environmental factor; intermediate water; marine ecosystem; spatial distribution; stratification; water mass; Conservation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151022951"

This study aimed to assess the current protected area system’s effectiveness and to identify priority conservation areas for expanding the existing protected area system. We used the distribution models of 1186 species from three kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, and Fungi) together with ZONATION software, a conservation planning tool, to determine areas that could help expand the current network of protected areas. We applied three different parametrizations (including only species, using the boundary quality penalty, and using corridor connectivity). We found that protecting an additional 15% of the area would increase, between 16.2% and 19.3%, the protection of the distribution area of all species. We propose that the regions with a consensus of the three parametrizations should be declared as new protected areas to expand 374 km2 to the 216 km2 already protected. Doing so would double the protected surface in central Veracruz. The priority areas identified in this study have more species richness, carbon stock values, natural vegetation cover, and less human impact index than the existing protected areas. If our identified priority areas are declared protected, we could expect a future recovery of endangered species populations for Veracruz. The proposed new protected areas are planned and designed as corridors connecting currently isolated protected areas to promote biodiversity protection. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biodiversity; central Veracruz; conservation policy; habitat loss; Mexico; systematic conservation planning","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145502946"

Therefore, it is remarkable that coral diversity usually does not play a role in the planning of protected areas in coral reef areas. In the present study we examine how stony coral diversity patterns relate to marine park zonation and the economic value of reefs around St. Eustatius, a small island in the eastern Caribbean, with fisheries and tourism as important sources of income. The marine park contains two no-take reserves. A biodiversity survey was performed at 39 sites, 24 inside the reserves and 15 outside; 22 had a maximum depth >18 m and 17 were shallower. Data on economic value per site were obtained from the literature. Corals were photographed for the verification of identifications made in the field. Coral species richness (n = 49) was highest in the no-take reserves and species composition was mainly affected by maximum depth. No distinct relation is observed between coral diversity and fishery value or total economic value. Based on the outcome of this study we suggest that in future designs of marine park zonation in reef areas, coral diversity should be taken into consideration. This is best served by including reef areas with a continuous depth gradient from shallow flats to deep slopes. © 2022 The Authors","Conservation; Coral reefs; Depth gradient; Habitat diversity; Marine protected area; Stony corals","Animals; Anthozoa; Biodiversity; Caribbean Region; Coral Reefs; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Leeward Islands [Lesser Antilles]; Saint Eustatius; biodiversity; biozonation; coastal zone; conservation planning; coral reef; economic analysis; investment; marine park; species diversity; species richness; water depth; article; biodiversity; Caribbean; clinical article; coral; coral reef; fishery; habitat; species composition; species richness; tourism; zonation; animal; Anthozoa; Caribbean; ecosystem","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135903660"

It is specific to defined areas along the northern region of Dhofar in Oman. This study reviews the management of the Omani abalone fishery during the last 31 y, identifies the challenges encountered, and suggests solutions to overcome these difficulties. During the period 1988-2018, annual abalone landings ranged from 29 tonnes (mt) in 1999 to 149 mt in 2011, with an average of 53 mt. In 2019, landings 24 t (53 t whole weight) were reported to be the lowest in the last three decades and landed within 10 days of opening. The fishery generated 1.3 million Omani rials (3.38 million US$) (OR, where 1 OR = 2.6 USD) in 1993 and 8.2 million OR in 2011, with an average of 2.5 million OR (6.5 million US$). By contrast, the average annual price per kg was 50 OR (130 US$). The fishery was mainly managed in accordance with seasonal closures, which ranged from 6 mo to less than 1 mo; in one case, there was a complete suspension of fishing for 3 y. The number of fishers engaged in this fishery was not stable, and fluctuated between 1,450 in 1993 and 8,539 in 2014. The seasonal closures between 1988 and 2003 resulted in a gradual decrease in average landings, reaching 2%-45% at the end of the season, with an average of 27%. The percentage of divers who participated at the end of the season ranged from 9% to 90%, with an average of 47%. It is suggested that the government should conduct comprehensive research to assess the Omani abalone stock, population dynamics, and habitat, as well as the behavior of the fishermen. Furthermore, better data collection and monitoring systems should be established. It is strongly recommended that a ""pulse fishing"" or spatial-based or temporary marine-protected area fishing (zonation) approach that serves the objectives of stock and habitat preservation be implemented. Thus, the restoration of the Omani abalone fishery is achievable but will require long-term research efforts. © 2020 National Shellfisheries Association.

Comparisons were made between the Cwebe and Dwesa sections of the MPA on either side of the Mbhashe Estuary, as well as between two partially protected areas (PPAs) and two no-take zones in the Dwesa section, which came into effect in January 2016. A total of 7 241 fish representing 43 species were recorded, where 39.5% of the species are endemic, 29.5% are considered threatened by the IUCN, and 27.3% are either overexploited, collapsed or in decline. Of 3 963 tagged fish, 128 (3.2%) recaptures were recorded, of which most (62%) exhibited no movement. Localised differences in species diversity, size frequency and CPUE were detected between the Dwesa and Cwebe sections, and lower average length and CPUE of some species were recorded in the Dwesa PPAs compared with in the Dwesa no-take zones. These differences were more prominent in slow-growing, long-lived species with small home ranges, indicating the negative impacts of fishing pressure on vulnerable species found in this MPA and a reduction in benefits that would otherwise be associated with no-take zonation. These findings highlight the need to revisit the rezoning of the MPA with regard to the size of the no-take zones and emphasise the need for effective law enforcement to ensure adherence to existing regulations. © 2021 NISC (Pty) Ltd.","CPUE; Eastern Cape coast; fish diversity; fish population recovery; marine partially protected areas; mark-recapture; monitoring; MPA zonation","Cwebe; Dwesa Nature Reserve; Eastern Cape; South Africa; assessment method; biomineralization; catch per unit effort; law enforcement; relative abundance; resource use; surf zone","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115146732"

We identified three management systems that can impact in different ways on fava d’anta populations, depending on the area and level of human interference with the species. The extractivists respect the zoning of protected areas and do not enter in the full protection area, choosing areas with the highest tree density. The different systems produce a mosaic that creates different extraction opportunities and modifications to the local landscape and to fava d’anta populations. Factors that may have effects on the conservation of the species are the lack of supervision and overexploitation of the resource in native areas, while the factors that affect the health of extractivists are the infrastructure of the work and exposure to wild environments. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Conservation unit; Extractivism; Participatory mapping; Traditional ecological knowledge","Brazil; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ethnobotany; Fabaceae; Forests; Humans; Trees; Brazil; Ceara; Chapada do Araripe; Dimorphandra; Arid regions; Data mining; Environmental protection; Plants (botany); Conservation strategies; Conservation units; Extractivism; Human interference; Non-timber forest products; Northeastern Brazil; Pharmacological properties; Traditional ecological knowledge; conservation management; ethnobotany; exploitation; habitat mosaic; knowledge; management practice; mapping method; participatory approach; protected area; semiarid region; traditional knowledge; wild population; Article; Brazil; demography; Dimorphandra gardneriana; environmental management; environmental protection; ethnobotany; Fabaceae; nonhuman; plantation; pollination; species habitat; structured questionnaire; zonation; forest; human; tree; Conservation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078226153"

Understanding it’s spatial ecology in the context of current Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is vital to not only inform population dynamics and ecological roles, but to determine whether currently zoned MPAs can provide sufficient protection to this species. Twenty-seven individuals were monitored using the Acoustic Tracking Array Platform (ATAP—a nation-wide collaborative network of acoustic receivers) for up to 4.5 years. Individuals displayed site affinity to defined regions of the coast, with the majority of detections for most individuals being recorded in the shallow bay/coastal shelf they were tagged in. However, important movement corridors linking different habitats were also identified (inshore vs offshore and coastal bay vs coastal shelf habitats). This habitat use varied monthly and was influenced by temperature, with individuals displaying restricted movements to the shallow bay habitat in summer when deeper waters were much colder. The large collaborative nature of the ATAP allowed for the monitoring of a benthic ray across large spatial scales for the first time, challenging preconceived notions that small undulatory batoids cannot travel large distances (many individuals were found to travel up to 200 km). Insights can also assist in local management of this species, and highlight that current MPA zonation may not be sufficient to protect blue stingrays from further population declines. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Acoustic telemetry; Dasyatidae; Dasyatis chrysonota; South Africa; Spatial ecology","South Africa; bay; coastal water; connectivity; fish; habitat use; monitoring system; movement; population dynamics; summer; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141375303"

To safeguard biodiversity, conservation actions must be distributed in places that represent ecosystem and species diversity. Various methods of prioritizing sites for conservation have been used in local and global assessments. However, the performance and consequences of alternative methods are usually unknown. Such comparisons are needed to confidently implement national and international conservation initiatives. Here, we compared four widely-used methods of prioritizing sites in the contiguous United States for conserving species of mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles. Specifically, we calculated and mapped species richness, rarity-weighted richness, and two complementarity-based prioritizations (additive benefit function [ABF] and core area zonation [CAZ] in the software Zonation). We compared maps derived from these alternatives with respect to spatial locations and overlap, patch size distributions of the top-30% priorities, and existing ownership and protected-area status. We used species-accumulation curves across ranked priorities to evaluate performance of methods and compared results at 30% total area. Mapped locations and patch sizes of the highest priorities varied by taxonomic class and method of prioritization. Complementarity-based methods (ABF and CAZ) more efficiently represented species than methods based on richness or rarity-weighted richness, especially for taxa with higher beta diversity (amphibians). ABF and CAZ methods also resulted in greater conservation opportunity for the top 30% of priorities compared to maps of richness. Area-based conservation targets, such as the “30 by 30” initiative, must distribute limited resources in ways that safeguard all species. Our results show that spatial locations and configuration, performance, and conservation opportunity vary among prioritization methods and taxonomic classes. © 2021 The Authors","Area-based targets; Beta diversity; Complementarity; Conservation planning; Zonation","United States; Amphibia; Mammalia; Reptilia; amphibian; biodiversity; conservation status; ownership; prioritization; spatiotemporal analysis; species diversity; species richness; strategic approach","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118825679"

We created maps of relative habitat suitability, converted them into maps of species critical habitat, and the latter served as input to the spatial conservation prioritization program Zonation. Although all studied species were extremely rare, the extent of their predicted critical habitat ranged from 2.6 to 15,508 km2 and did not correlate with the number of occurrence records. It appears that the extent of the threatened species predicted suitable area is an indicator of whether the species rarity is inherent due to vary narrow ecological niche or caused solely by anthropogenic activity. This has important conservation implications. Imperiled species from the first category are less amenable (if at all) to such conservation actions as trans- or relocation (i.e. there is no alternative to protecting the last remaining populations). Species from the second group can potentially grow in many more locations than they currently occupy, and therefore, for these species, translocation can be the most appropriate strategy when their last remaining locations are degraded or can not be protected for whatever reason. Based on results of nature reserve design that utilized SDM-predicted maps for 50 imperiled species, we recommend adding new areas to the existing network of protected areas to cover critical habitats of highly threatened plant species. The highest priority for adding have the territories harboring critical habitat of disproportionally high number of imperiled species, and we found that they all are concentrated in the eastern part of Uzbekistan. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Critical habitat; Plant conservation; Protected areas; Reserve design; Species distribution modeling; Zonation","Uzbekistan; Indicator indicator; conservation status; habitat type; nature reserve; plant; prioritization; rarity; reserve design; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; translocation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111770834"

However, knowledge shortfalls still remain, hindering possibilities to improve decision making and built such policies. During the last 2 decades, conservationists have made great efforts to allocate resources as efficiently as possible but have rarely considered the idea that if research investments are also strategically allocated, it would likely fill knowledge gaps while simultaneously improving conservation actions. Therefore, prioritizing areas where both conservation and research actions could be conducted becomes a critical endeavor that can further maximize return on investment. We used Zonation, a conservation planning tool and geographical distributions of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles to suggest and compare priority areas for conservation and research of terrestrial vertebrates worldwide. We also evaluated the degree of human disturbance in both types of priority areas by describing the value of the human footprint index within such areas. The spatial concordance between priority conservation and research areas was low: 0.36% of the world's land area. In these areas, we found it would be possible to protect almost half of the currently threatened species and to gather information on nearly 42% of data-deficient (DD) species. We also found that 6199 protected areas worldwide are located in such places, although only 35% of them have strict conservation purposes. Areas of consensus between conservation and research areas represent an opportunity for simultaneously conserving and acquiring knowledge of threatened and DD species of vertebrates. Although the picture is not the most encouraging, joint conservation and research efforts are possible and should be fostered to save vertebrate species from our own ignorance and extinction. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology","conservation investment; conservation planning; decision making; inversión en la conservación; planeación de la conservación; priority research areas; protected areas; toma de decisiones; áreas prioritarias para la investigación; áreas protegidas","Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Endangered Species; Humans; Reptiles; Vertebrates; Amphibia; Aves; Mammalia; Reptilia; Vertebrata; action plan; conservation planning; decision making; endangered species; extinction; geographical distribution; vertebrate; animal; biodiversity; endangered species; environmental protection; human; reptile; vertebrate","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085103786"

The European Union strives to increase protected areas of the EU terrestrial surface to 30% by year 2030, of which one third should be strictly protected. Designation of the Natura 2000 network, the backbone of nature protection in the EU, was mostly an expert-opinion process with little systematic conservation planning. The designation of the Natura 2000 network in Romania followed the same non-systematic approach, resulting in a suboptimal representation of invertebrates and plants. To help identify areas with very high biodiversity without repeating past planning missteps, we present a reproducible example of spatial prioritization using Romania’s current terrestrial Natura 2000 network and coarse-scale terrestrial species occurrence. Methods. We used 371 terrestrial Natura 2000 Sites of Community Importance (Natura 2000 SCI), designated to protect 164 terrestrial species listed under Annex II of Habitats Directive in Romania in our spatial prioritization analyses (marine Natura 2000 sites and species were excluded). Species occurrences in terrestrial Natura 2000 sites were aggregated at a Universal Traverse Mercator spatial resolution of 1 km2. To identify priority terrestrial Natura 2000 sites for species conservation, and to explore if the Romanian Natura 2000 network sufficiently represents species included in Annex II of Habitats Directive, we used Zonation v4, a decision support software tool for spatial conservation planning. We carried out the analyses nationwide (all Natura 2000 sites) as well as separately for each biogeographic region (i.e., Alpine, Continental, Pannonian, Steppic and Black Sea). Results. The results of spatial prioritization of terrestrial Natura 2000 vary greatly by planning scenario. The performance of national-level planning of top priorities is minimal. On average, when 33% of the landscape of Natura 2000 sites is protected, only 20% of the distribution of species listed in Annex II of Habitats Directive are protected. As a consequence, the representation of species by priority terrestrial Natura 2000 sites is lessened when compared to the initial set of species. When planning by taxonomic group, the top-priority areas include only 10% of invertebrate distribution in Natura 2000. When selecting top-priority areas by biogeographical region, there are significantly fewer gap species than in the national level and by taxa scenarios; thusly, the scenario outperforms the national-level prioritization. The designation of strictly protected areas as required by the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 should be followed by setting clear objectives, including a good representation of species and habitats at the biogeographical region level.

Additionally, human populations living in these ecosystems are predicted to increase, exposing wildlife to additional human-induced top-down constraints and intensifying human-wildlife conflicts. We aim to investigate how surface water availability, forage availability and other landscape factors shape the spatial arrangement of large herbivore populations in a desert region, and to explore wildlife-livestock co-occurrence patterns to inform coexistence strategies that maximize conservation outputs. We fitted Bayesian zero-inflated binomial N-mixture models (Kéry and Royle 2015) to group count data collected over a 4 year period in the northern Namib desert (Iona National Park, Angola), and found that Hartmann’s mountain zebra and gemsbok preferentially forage in suboptimal low productivity flat areas, away from human activities. Conversely, springbok preferentially occurred in more productive and relatively rugged terrain. We also found a reliance of Hartmann’s mountain zebra on natural water sources (βDistWater= - 1.04 ± 0.26 and βDistWater= - 0.77 ± 0.20 , for dry and wet seasons, respectively), and a weaker reliance by gemsbok (βDistWater= 0.20 ± 0.10 and βDistWater= - 0.15 ± 0.10 , respectively for dry and wet seasons). Conversely, we found springbok to forage further from available water (βDistWater= 0.43 ± 0.05 and βDistWater= 0.26 ± 0.06 , for dry and wet seasons, respectively), suggesting this species may be able to balance hydric requirements from dietary water. Our results support that human activities (inc. livestock herding) induce broad scale top-down regulation in landscape use by our target species, which are then susceptible to resource-driven bottom-up forces at a finer scale. These constraints reflect differences between the realized and expected conservation value of Iona National Park, because human-occupied areas force wildlife to suboptimal habitats. Additionally, we found significant stretches of the landscape to be co-occupied by wildlife and livestock, increasing competition for already limited resources. Our results are useful for informing conservation actions, namely through protected area zonation. Securing exclusive access to key resources by wildlife could be of utmost importance to ensure the long-term survival of these species, and to foster sustained human-wildlife coexistence. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Bottom-up regulation; Climate change; Hartmann’s mountain zebra; Human-wildlife coexistence; Namib desert; Surface water dependency","Angola; Argyll and Bute; Hebrides; Inner Hebrides; Iona; Iona National Park; Namibe; Scotland; United Kingdom; extinction risk","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131750784"

Methods: Based on literature, we summarize the role of connectivity as one component of relevance in the broad structure of spatial prioritization in both marine and terrestrial realms. Results: Partially diffuse, directed connectivity can be approximated in Zonation-based multi-criteria SCP by applying hydrodynamic modelling, knowledge on species traits, and information on species occurrences and quality of habitats. Sources and destinations of larvae or propagules can be identified as separate spatial layers and taken into account in full-scale spatial prioritization involving data on biota, as well as economic factors, threats, and administrative constraints. While population connectivity is an important determinant of metapopulation persistence, the importance of marine connectivity depends on species traits and the marine environment studied. At one end of the continuum are species that occupy isolated habitats and have long pelagic larval durations in deeper sea areas with strong directional currents. At the other extreme are species with short pelagic durations that occupy fragmented habitats in shallow topographically complex sea areas with weak and variable currents. Conclusions: We conclude that the same objectives, methods, and analysis structures are applicable to both terrestrial and marine spatial prioritization. Marine spatial conservation planning, marine spatial planning, marine zoning, etc., can be implemented using methods originated in the terrestrial realm of planning. © 2020, The Author(s).","Ecosystem services; Marine connectivity; Marine spatial planning; Systematic conservation planning; Zonation software","connectivity; conservation planning; habitat management; hydrodynamics; marine policy; metapopulation; network design; protected area; restoration ecology; topography","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084670120"

In this study, we aim to investigate the distribution and diversity of endemic true bugs for four family groups (i.e., Miridae, Lygaeoidea, Pentatomidae, and Reduviidae) in China, the environmental factors shaping these diversity patterns, and the effectiveness of China's PAs in safeguarding their diversity. Location: China. Methods: We mapped the spatial distributions of 1028 endemic true bugs in China using stacked species distribution models and pixel grids of observed points. The environmental factors that influence diversity patterns across China were explored by generalized linear models and random forest models. The effectiveness of PAs in safeguarding species distributions was evaluated by the Zonation platform. Main results: We found that most (84.9%) diversity hotspots for total species were located in mountainous areas of southern China. Additionally, the diversity patterns are shaped by the combined effects of different environmental factors, with the minimum temperature of the coldest month, annual precipitation, and elevation showing the strongest effects. On average, Chinese PAs covered 10.2% of the distribution areas of these endemic true bugs. Main conclusions: In general, our research identifies the important roles of mountainous areas in southern China in maintaining species diversity. Moreover, our research also suggests that PAs in China could not provide sufficient protection for this diversity. Protecting these endemic true bugs diversity should be valued more in mountainous areas of southern China. © 2022 The Authors.

It plays an essential role in maintaining the stability of regional forest communities. Moreover, it is an essential economic tree species in Northeast Asia. In recent years, the impact of rapid climate change on the distribution and adaptability of plant populations has received increasing attention. However, there is still a knowledge gap in our understanding of the future distribution changes of this important species. In this study, we used the ensemble species distribution model to simulate the distribution of T. amurensis in China under different climate scenarios. In addition, we used Fragstats and Zonation software based on the result of the ensemble species distribution model and combining the multi-year land use data. Using this method, we can clarify the landscape pattern changes and priority protection areas of T. amurensis. The results showed that the suitable area of T. amurensis in China was mainly located in the northeast region. The area of forest habitat suitable for T. amurensis has gradually decreased, and the fragmentation degree has progressively increased over the past 40 years. Under the background of future climate change, the suitable area of T. amurensis could move progressively to high latitude and high altitude, and the total area could show an upward trend. However, the area of the high suitable area could decrease sharply with the increase of year and carbon emissions. Six environmental factors: altitude (Alt), precipitation in the warmest quarter (Bio18), mean temperature of the driest quarter (Bio09), min temperature of the coldest month (Bio06), temperature seasonality (Bio04), and isothermality (Bio03), play a crucial role in the spatial distribution of T. amurensis. The counties in Northeast China are the most suitable areas for protecting T. amurensis action, located in the southern Xiaoxing'an Mountains and northern Changbai Mountains counties. In addition, among the existing protected areas, Fenglin National Nature Reserve has the highest area of mandatory reserves. It is expected to become a preferred location for T. amurensis conservation actions. Our results can provide a helpful reference for the effective protection and sustainable utilization of T. amurensis under climate change. © 2023 The Authors","Climate change; Conservation areas; Landscape pattern changes; Species distribution model; Suitable area; Tilia amurensis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150461352"

However, little is known concerning the spatial assessment and dynamic adjustment mechanisms aimed at the synergistic protection of BD and ESs. This study employed a combined modeling approach, MaxEnt-InVEST-Zonation, to identify the theoretically prioritized protected areas for BD. This approach considers the potential distribution of species under the influence of natural conditions and human activities. The InVEST and CASA models were used to evaluate the theoretically prioritized protected areas for ESs. Then, the theoretically prioritized protected areas for BD and ESs were integrated to obtain a comprehensive theoretically prioritized ecological reserve (PER) that realized the integration of the areas with high levels of ecosystem function and suitable habitats for rare species. The integrated BD and ES assessment approaches were implemented in Xiamen City, China. A total area of 374.52 km2 of PER was identified, and 62.3% of the existing ecological redline had high ES and BD protection values. The unprotected PER accounted for 9.46% of the total area of Xiamen. With an increasing intensity of human activities, the theoretically prioritized protected areas for BD and ESs along with their spatial consistency gradually decreased. The proposed approach for identifying PER by integrating BD and ESs could be used to evaluate the rationality and effectiveness of the existing ecological redline and provide a basis for the dynamic adjustment management of PER. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Comprehensive theoretically prioritized ecological reserve; Ecosystem services; MaxEnt-InVEST-Zonation combined modeling; Spatial dynamic management","China; Fujian; Xiamen; Conservation; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Combined modeling; Comprehensive theoretically prioritized ecological reserve; Dynamic management; Ecological reserves; Ecosystem services; Human activities; Maxent-InVEST-zonation combined modeling; Protected areas; Spatial dynamic management; Spatial dynamics; biodiversity; ecosystem service; environmental management; environmental protection; nature reserve; policy implementation; protected area; theoretical study; article; biodiversity; China; habitat; human; nonhuman; rare species; zonation; Biodiversity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121982700"

Here, a conservation status assessment was conducted for the marine vertebrate biodiversity of two recently designated marine protected areas in the Republic of Seychelles. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessments were compiled and trends in data analysed for the 524 species recorded locally. Findings suggest that 5.5–23.1% of all marine vertebrate biodiversity at the site is threatened or near-threatened with extinction (combined as ‘elevated risk’), and highlights sharks and rays as contributing two thirds (67.9%) to the ‘elevated risk’ biodiversity of the site. Fishing activities constitute the largest threat to every ‘elevated risk’ species using the site, with sharks and rays being most impacted. Species richness analysis across major habitat types evidence the high value of coral reef areas to almost all species and the importance of adjacent deep-water areas for ‘elevated risk’ species. Theoretical national assessments showed that the majority of globally ER species remained in the same Red List category in their respective national assessment. This study demonstrates the value of global Red List data for optimising research efforts and conservation practices on a localised scale and for informing the design and zonation of marine protected areas. © 2022 by the authors.","elasmobranch; extinction risk; marine biodiversity; marine protected areas; Red List; species conservation","Seychelles; conservation; extinction risk; finfish; marine ecosystem; protected area; Red List; shark; trend analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137319834"

Methodologically, we describe a novel algorithm for implementing spatial priority ranking, novel alternatives for balancing between biodiversity features, fast tiled FFT transforms for connectivity calculations based on dispersal kernels, and a novel analysis output, the flexibility map. Marking by N the number of landscape elements with data, the new prioritization algorithm has time scaling of less than Nlog2N instead of the N2 of its predecessor. We illustrate feasible computation times with data up to billions of elements in size, implying capacity for global analysis at a resolution higher than 0.25 km2, or close to 1-ha resolution for a continent.

This territory is a part of two federal protected areas because of its peculiar nature.

Key soil types are presented by Leptosols, Cambisols, Retisols, Chernozems, Fluvisols and Technosols. By the example of the recognized upland macrolandscape, it is shown that the usual gradual course of soil zonation significantly changes due to the transformation of the soil-forming potential of the environment. The obtained data can be used for further regional verification of soil taxonomy. In addition, since the role of parent materials increases as they move from the west to the east of the East European Plain, parameterization of the role of this process becomes particularly important.

The Akanda National Park (ANP) in Gabon, almost exclusively constituted by mangroves, is part of a green belt of protected areas around the capital city of Libreville. The creation of the ANP is considered as an essential tool for the ecosystemic management of fisheries in Mondah Bay, playing nursery function for several exploited fish species. However, this role has never been documented in the mangroves of Gabon. The aim of this study is to describe the spatial and seasonal variability of fish assemblages, to assess ANP mangrove role as a nursery for fish juveniles. Fish sampling was carried out at four different sites in the four hydroclimatic seasons in Gabon using trammel gillnets with different mesh size (10, 27 and 40 mm). Fifty-nine fish species mainly estuarine and marine, first and second level predators were collected whatever the season and the site. The numerically dominant species were Pseudotolithus elongatus, Pellonula leonensis and Parachelon grandisquamis (48% of the total number of individuals), whereas P. elongatus, Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus and Plectorhinchus macrolepis represented the main biomasses (55%). The predominance in the catches of immature individuals of many species of commercial interest and in particular, P. elongatus, P. grandisquamis, C. nigrodigitatus, Eucinostomus melanopterus, Neochelon falcipinnis and Polydactylus quadrifilis, which dominate the community, highlights the importance of Akanda mangrove as a nursery for the juveniles of these species. The results of our study are a first step in understanding the fish communities of a Gabon marine protected area, which can support the decision making management plans, zonation and initiate a monitoring program for the estuarine and marine protected ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Communities; Conservation; Diversity; Fisheries; Mangroves; Nursery","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145320345"

Under postulated low glacial bottom-water oxygen concentrations (O2 bw), redox zonation, biogeochemical processes and element fluxes in the sediments must have been distinctively different during the last glacial period (LGP) compared to current well-oxygenated conditions. In this study, we have investigated six sites situated in various European contract areas for the exploration of polymetallic nodules within the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the NE Pacific and one site located in a protected Area of Particular Environmental Interest (APEI3) north of the CCZ. We found bulk sediment Mn maxima of up to 1 wt% in the upper oxic 10 cm of the sediments at all sites except for the APEI3 site. The application of a combined leaching protocol for the extraction of sedimentary Mn and Fe minerals revealed that mobilizable Mn(IV) represents the dominant Mn(oxyhydr)oxide phase with more than 70% of bulk solid-phase Mn. Steady state transport-reaction modeling showed that at postulated glacial O2 bw of 35 μM, the oxic zone in the sediments was much more compressed than today where upward diffusing pore-water Mn2+ was oxidized and precipitated as authigenic Mn(IV) at the oxic-suboxic redox boundary in the upper 5 cm of the sediments. Transient transport-reaction modeling demonstrated that with increasing O2 bw during the last glacial termination to current levels of ∼ 150 μM, (1) the oxic-suboxic redox boundary migrated deeper into the sediments and (2) the authigenic Mn(IV) peak was continuously mixed into subsequently deposited sediments by bioturbation causing the observed mobilizable Mn(IV) enrichment in the surface sediments. Such a distinct mobilizable Mn(IV) maximum was not found in the surface sediments of the APEI3 site, which indicates that the oxic zone was not as condensed during the LGP at this site due to two- to threefold lower organic carbon burial rates. Leaching data for sedimentary Fe minerals suggest that Fe(III) has not been diagenetically redistributed during the LGP at any of the investigated sites. Our results demonstrate that the basin-wide deoxygenation in the NE Pacific during the LGP was associated with (1) a much more compressed oxic zone at sites with carbon burial fluxes higher than 1.5 mg Corg m−2 d−1, (2) the authigenic formation of a sub-surface mobilizable Mn(IV) maximum in the upper 5 cm of the sediments and (3) a possibly intensified suboxic-diagenetic growth of polymetallic nodules. As our study provides evidence that authigenic Mn(IV) precipitated in the surface sediments under postulated low glacial O2 bw, it contributes to resolving a long-standing controversy concerning the origin of widely observed Mn-rich layers in glacial/deglacial deep-sea sediments. © 2019 The Authors","CCZ; last glacial period; manganese; ocean oxygenation; polymetallic nodules; redox zonation","Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Conservation; Digital storage; Glacial geology; Iron compounds; Leaching; Manganese; Manganese nodules; Manganese removal (water treatment); Oceanography; Organic carbon; Oxygenation; Salinity measurement; Sedimentology; Surficial sediments; Biogeochemical process; Carbon dioxide storage; Clarion-Clipperton zone; Last glacial period; Last glacial terminations; Organic carbon burial rates; Redox zonation; Steady-state transport; Oxic sediments","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076571903"

Standard vegetation analysis and secondary data were utilized in the data collection process. Results showed 242 species, 72 families of 78 tree species, 90 shrubs and small trees, and 37 epiphytes. About 112 species are threatened, 35 of which are Philippine endemics. Two altitudinal zones were identified using the cluster analysis: Zone I (643 to 1,256 m asl.), dominated by Crypteronia paniculata, Acer laurinum, Weinmannia hutchinsonii, and Syzygium sp.; and Zone II (1421 to 1470 m asl.) dominated by Dacrydium cf. beccarii. Zone I was further subdivided into three clusters: Zone IA (643 to 985 m asl.), Zone IB (908 to 913 m asl.), and Zone IC (822 to 1,182 m asl.). Canonical correspondence analysis illustrated that environmental factors (N, Altitude, and human disturbance) influenced the zonation of vegetation or species abundance.

Therefore, it is necessary to consider these impacts when managing marine areas. One of the most applied tools in recent years to deal with this are species distribution models, however there are still some challenges to solve, such as the inclusion of hydrodynamic predictors and the application of effective, transferable and user-oriented methodologies. Five species (Saccorhiza polyschides, Gelidium spinosum, Sargassum muticum, Pelvetia canaliculata and Cystoseira baccata)in Europe and 15 variables were considered. Nine of them were projected to the RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 for the mid-term (2040–2069)and the long term (2070–2099). Algorithms for each species were applied to generate models that were assessed by comparison of probabilities and observations (area under the curve, true skill statistics, Boyce index, sensitivity, correct classification rate), niches overlap (Schoener's D, Hellinger's I), geographical similarity (interquartile range)and ecological realism. Models built demonstrated very good predictive accuracy and sensitivity, without overfitting risk. A medium overlap in the historical and RCPs environmental conditions were obtained, therefore the models can be considered transferable and results accurate because only some isolated points were detected as outliers, corresponding to low probabilities. The areas of S. polyschides and G. spinosum have been identified to be dramatically reduced, meanwhile S. muticum and C. baccata were predicted to expand their range. P. canaliculata was expected to keep its sites of presence but with a decrease in its probability of occurrence. For all species it was remarkable the importance of hydrodynamic variables and parameters representing extreme conditions. Spatially predictions of the potential species and areas at risk are decisive for defining management strategies and resource allocation. The performance and usefulness of the approach applied in this study have been demonstrated for algae with different ecological requirements (from upper littoral to subtidal)and distributional patterns (native and invasive), therefore results can be used by marine planners with different goals: marine protected areas designation, monitoring efforts guiding, invasions risk assessment or aquaculture facilities zonation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Algae; Ecological niche; Global change; Marine ecology; Physiological thresholds; Species distribution models","Climate Change; Ecological Parameter Monitoring; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Hydrodynamics; Marine Biology; Models, Biological; Phaeophyta; Rhodophyta; Salinity; Seaweed; Temperature; Europe; algae; Cystoseira baccata; Gelidium; Pelvetia canaliculata; Saccorhiza polyschides; Sargassum muticum; Algae; Conservation; Ecosystems; Hydrodynamics; Physiological models; Population distribution; Risk assessment; Seaweed; Ecological niche; Global change; Marine ecology; Physiological thresholds; Species distribution models; climate change; global change; marine ecosystem; niche; physiological response; seaweed; spatial distribution; threshold; aquaculture; area under the curve; article; climate change; ecological niche; Europe; global change; hydrodynamics; littoral; marine biology; monitoring; nonhuman; prediction; probability; resource allocation; risk assessment; Sargassum; seaweed; skill; species distribution; statistics; zonation; biological model; brown alga; ecosystem; ecosystem monitoring; environmental monitoring; Europe; growth, development and aging; marine biology; procedures; red alga; salinity; temperature; Climate change","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065164484"

This study aimed to design a conservation landscape that would maximize the conservation of the DCH’s ecological integrity, endangered species, and ecological and evolutionary processes. Five focal species of high conservation value were chosen based on their ecological roles, conservation status, or endemism: white-lipped peccary Tayassu pecari, chacoan peccary Catagonus wagneri, giant anteater Myrmecophaga tridactyla, tapir Tapirus terrestris, and giant armadillo Priodontes maximus. We used interviews with local informants to obtain information on species presence and location. Their habitat suitability was modelled and ranked using Maxent software. A conservation landscape was designed by overlapping these spatially explicit models. A systematic conservation planning framework was followed, considering habitat connectivity using Zonation. Interviews proved to be useful for conservation planning in this region with longstanding close ethnozoological relationships. The spatial design obtained was compared with existing land-use policies and protected areas to discuss conservation strategies that could be efficient if applied in the DCH and considering land sharing vs. land sparing conservation strategies. There is a large surface of suitable habitat for the studied species, but their conservation cannot be ensured with the present conservation schemes.

A critical review of Indian legislation impacting the Ganga was carried out to examine conservation issues from a policy perspective. Thereafter, existing conservation planning approaches were reviewed to identify the most strategic option. The analysis suggests that the disregard for river connectivity, lack of protection, and incoherent sectoral policies hinder river conservation in India. Strategic prioritisation and zonation of the Ganga along the principles of prohibition, restriction and regulated resource use and creation of ‘optimal sites’ for biodiversity conservation under multiple management zones was recommended.

Significant site-and zonation-specific differences were observed in a range of soil parameters (e.g. pH, conductivity, Na, Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe). Overall, milkweed numbers did not differ significantly according to wetland zonation, but differed significantly among sites. However, in turn, both plant heights and stem numbers related significantly to habitat zonation and sampling sites. Whilst unrelated to most soil properties, milkweed variables were found to relate significantly positively to Mn (abundance), negatively to Cu and positively to P (stem numbers). Furthermore, principal components analyses concerning milkweed abundances indicated clear patterning across sites, finding strong associations with soil variables (i.e. soluble S, Mn, pH, Na, SOM and conductivity). The present study illustrates distributions of a non-native plant species and assesses how its characteristics relate to environmental properties in an internationally recognised protected area. This information could be employed to help predict future distributions and better target management efforts towards sites at high-risk of invasion. © Dalu et al.","Invasion success; Non-native species; Plant characteristics; Ramsar wetland; Soil chemistry","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090542551"

Nevertheless, the quality of SDM varies widely and may compromise the effectiveness of protected areas. Here we reviewed whether SDM overprediction is considered in spatial conservation prioritization exercises and evaluated how model overprediction influences the effectiveness and the spatial arrangement of priority areas. To do so, we carried out a systematic review to analyze how researchers have handled SDM overprediction when identifying priority areas for conservation. To show how spatial conservation prioritization outcomes are affected by SDM overprediction, we used SDM of native palm at three geographic scales (Neotropics, Amazon ecoregion, and Ecuadorian Amazon). We found that only 10% of the evaluated manuscripts accounted for model overprediction. Our spatial conservation prioritization based on SDM with overprediction conferred high priority rank values in a region where species do not occur, underestimated the efficiency of selected priority areas, and over or underestimated the efficiency of current protected areas. Such effects were lower at smaller geographic extents. Our findings highlight the importance of improving future spatial conservation prioritization studies through the correction of SDM overprediction, resulting in the detection of more adequate areas for species conservation, especially at broader extents. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Commission error; Conservation decisions; Systematic conservation planning; Zonation","Amazonia; conservation planning; correction; detection method; numerical model; prioritization; protected area; spatial analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096192486"

Here, we estimated the impacts of future climate change on phylogenetic diversity (PD) of Neotropical palms under varying climatic and dispersal scenarios, assessed the effectiveness of the established network of protected areas (PAs) for conserving palms PD today and in 2070, and identified priority areas for the conservation of palm species and their evolutionary history in the face of climate change. Location: Neotropics. Methods: We used ecological niche modelling to estimate the distribution of 367 species in the present and for 2070 based on two greenhouse gas emission and two dispersal scenarios. We calculated Faith's PD within each five arc-minute grid cell to evaluate the effectiveness of PAs relative to null models and used phylogenetic spatial prioritisation analysis to detect priority areas. Results: We found that even under the most optimistic climatic and dispersal scenarios, the established network of PAs performed poorly in safeguarding palms PD under both current conditions and those projected for 2070. Significant losses in PD inside PAs are expected under future climate conditions, especially if species are unable to disperse to suitable areas. Nevertheless, a modest and strategic increase in the number of PAs could considerably improve the protection of palms PD in the present and 2070. Main conclusions: The PD of Neotropical palms is poorly represented within the established network of PAs, at both present and in 2070. A higher realised dispersal rates would diminish PD losses inside the network of PAs. The conservation of palm PD can be improved through the expansion of PAs in strategic regions such as the upper portion of the Amazon Basin, Tropical Andes and Mesoamerica. © 2020 The Authors.

Based on existing PAME methodologies, we develop and propose the first quantitative tool for the evaluation of BR management effectiveness, that would enhance and complement the currently used qualitative PR report, and serve the rapid evaluation needed for BR managers to monitor, evaluate, and adapt their management approach to achieve the three functions of BRs. The tool consists of 65 indicators, embodied within the 6 elements of the World Commission on Protected Areas Framework. We then tested this tool, named Biosphere Reserve Effectiveness of Management index (BREMi) to evaluate management effectiveness across the Arab Man and the Biosphere Reserve network involving 17 BRs spanning 8 countries of the Middle East and North Africa. BREMi scores ranged from 4.43 to 8.65 (on a scale between 0 and 10), with a mean of 6.31 ± 1.040. All indicators were considered valuable measures of progress by our respondents, as well as by independent experts. We discuss our findings in light of available literature concerning the Arab region and through the conceptual frames of adaptive management and resilience.

We used in-situ conservation data to predict the potential habitat area of four flagship species: the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), golden monkey (Rhinopithecus roxella quinlingensis), takin (Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi), and crested ibis (Nipponia nippon). We then designed systematic conservation planning schemes for various scenarios given species habitat preferences and anthropogenic activities and conducted a cost-effectiveness assessment. Broadly, the geographical distributions of suitable habitats for giant pandas, golden monkeys, and takins exhibited high spatial congruence (correlation coefficients of 0.59–0.90), and areas of high congruence were concentrated in the northern portion of the Qinling Mountains at high elevation (>1500 m). By contrast, the crested ibis was negatively correlated in space with its sympatric species (−0.47 to −0.29). Crested ibis habitats were clustered in the southern portion of the region at low elevation (<1500 m). A hypothetical conservation priority area (CPA) based on the giant panda, golden monkey, and takin included 39.64% of the Qinling Mountains and 100%, 99.99%, 99.59%, and 7.84% of the suitable habitats for giant pandas, golden monkeys, takins, and crested ibises, respectively. The same area included 99.07%, 70.87%, and 39.96% of the highly important areas for the ecosystem services of biodiversity conservation, water supply, and soil retention, respectively, and only 4.62%, 16.83%, and 13.4% of the area were associated with high-density residential area, impervious surfaces, and cropland, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that a CPA approach based on the specialist species could result in effective, low-cost biodiversity conservation in the Qinling Mountains. However, we note that existing protected areas account for only 26.52% of the CPA. We recommend that the main area of the proposed Qinling National Park should be based on the CPA developed here. © 2021","Biodiversity; Ecosystem service; Ensemble model; Flagship species; Zonation","Animals; Anthropogenic Effects; Biodiversity; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Ecosystem; Ursidae; China; Qinling Mountains; biodiversity; conservation planning; ecosystem service; elevation; endangered species; habitat selection; specialist; animal experiment; article; China; conservation biology; correlation coefficient; cost effectiveness analysis; cropland; geographic distribution; giant panda; national park; nonhuman; residential area; Rhinopithecus; soil; species habitat; sympatry; takin; water supply; zonation; animal; bear; biodiversity; China; cost benefit analysis; ecosystem; environmental protection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121855203"

Then the changes of their habitat distribution and the species richness in different periods were compared. Finally, the Zonation model was used to identify the key protected areas of ungulate species. The results show that the MaxEnt model can well predict the distribution of ungulate species.

The distance to lakes and precipitation are the main factors affecting the distribution of most ungulate species. The habitats originally located in the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have mainly extended northeastwards, while the habitats originally located in the northwest has been largely lost. The changes in the habitats of ungulate species in the southeast and northwest are diametrically opposite.

We explored an area-efficient and balanced set of criteria to find areas that best complement existing protected areas for achieving these targets. We used distribution maps of all threatened vertebrates in a systematic conservation planning approach and compared four different methods of weighting species and locations: 1) species weighted equally, 2) weighted by distribution characteristics (i.e. presence, origin, seasonality) and important habitat surrogates (Important Bird Areas and Endemic Bird Areas), 3) species' level of endemism, and IUCN Red List threat status, and 4) considering opportunity cost based on levels of urbanization to reflect the current land's ecological conditions. We then determined the extent to which existing protected areas cover conservation priorities for different species groups, and explored how new priorities complement Iran's protected area network to achieve national target to protect 20 % of its land area. Our findings showed that parts of terrestrial ecoregions in the north, north-west and west of the country were consistently important in all scenarios, representing the best places to start increasing protected area coverage. Protecting 20 % of the country in the prioritizations constrained by existing protected areas would conserve biodiversity groups in 70 % to 100 % of their distribution, except for birds and mammals for which the protection coverage was lower.

Currently, hydroacoustics are widely used to determine seabed topography and sediment type, but significant developments have not occurred for detecting and classifying structures above the seabed, such as coral reefs and marine meadows, which are very important ecosystems. In the present study, we propose a new methodological approach to characterize the seabed at Serrana Bank (14.27°–14.48° N and 80.10°–80.23° W), located in the Colombian Basin of the Caribbean Sea, by combining acoustic information (split-beam echosounder) and underwater imagery. In all, 49 acoustic transects were created using a BioSonics DT-X scientific echosounder (with a 38-kHz split-beam transducer and a FURUNO differential GPS) during the Seaflower Scientific Expedition III (Colombian Ocean Commission, Colciencias) from August 12–15, 2016. Using cluster analysis with the Spearman correlation distance, 14 different Typical Acoustic Reflectance Profiles (TARPs) were identified at a distance of 0.80. These TARPs result from the natural acoustic signals produced by the sediment types and ecological structures present on the seabed. When comparing these TARPs with the photographic records and previous ecological maps, various ecological structures above the seabed were acoustically identified, such as coral debris, octocorals, macroalgae meadows, and several associations among coral and different sizes of macroalgae. The potential of this approach to generate a low-cost, automated method for mapping seabed ecosystems and to enable feasible assessments in marine protected areas is discussed. © 2019 The Authors","Acoustic reflectance profiles; Ecological structures; Remote sensors","Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Sea; Colombia; Seaflower Biosphere Reserve; Anthozoa; acoustic data; cluster analysis; coral reef; ecological modeling; ecological zonation; macroalga; meadow; photography; profiler; remote sensing; seafloor; sedimentation; surface reflectance; topography; underwater camera","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071940130"

Litter data were collected following a random stratified procedure. We registered litter occurrence on 180 (2 × 2 m) sampling plots randomly distributed in the different habitats of European conservation concern mapped for the analyzed protected areas. Litter was classified by origin and material, and their abundance on different habitats was explored by multivariate ordination techniques and tested by nonparametric ANOVA followed by Mann-Whitney pairwise post-hoc tests. Most of the plots included at least one waste element being plastic. Plastic was the most abundant material, and fishing and touristic the most polluting activities. Waste distribution varies across coastal dune vegetation types and involves the back dune zone too.

In April 2018, remote sensing was used to quantify land use and land cover changes between 1990 and 2015 based on satellite images acquired from North Atlantic Space Agency (LANDSAT TM, path 170 raw 73). Household surveys were administered using a structured questionnaire to 100 communal settlers to collect biophysical/socioecological data on explanatory variables which included; density of human and livestock, fuelwood consumption and area under cultivation. The study used multi-criteria evaluation procedure based on dynamic adjustments of socio-ecological data to generate transitional probability maps of SVC. Thresholds of socio-ecological data were then computed in the Markov-cellular automata model through a multi-objective land allocation procedure and a cellular automata spatial filter in order to simulate future land use and land cover maps of 2020, 2030 and 2040 for SVC. If the Zimbabwe land reform and its agricultural resettlement program is not properly coordinated and planned in the study area, the study predicted a continuing downward trend in woodland cover category and a significant upward trend of land under agriculture. For the period 1990 to the 2040s, the woodland cover is likely to decrease by 46.7% changing into agricultural land use and/or bare land in SVC. Future land use and land cover simulations indicated that if the current land use and land cover trends continue unabated across the study area without a holistic sustainable agricultural land-wildlife management plan and community development measures, severe woodland degradation will occur. The study recommends ecological restoration and/or re-planning on agriculture-wildlife land use and zonation, delineating agriculture and human settlement in the southern part of the conservancy while the northern part of SVC is exclusively reserved and protected for wildlife management. © 2020, Pakistan Agricultural Scientists Forum.

Overall, 30 seabird species within 1 110 groups of birds were sighted along 6 686 km of surveys conducted during favorable weather conditions (Beaufort < 5). Seabirds of the family Laridae were the most frequently observed, followed by those of the family Procellariidae. In waters over the continental slope, the most frequently observed species were Sooty Tern Onychoprion fuscatus; Brown Noddy Anous stolidus; Wilson’s Oceanites oceanicus and Leach’s Hydrobates leucorhous Storm Petrels; Great Ardenna gravis, Manx Puffinus puffinus, and Audubon’s Puffinus lherminieri Shearwaters; and Masked Booby Sula dactylatra. In waters over the shelf, the most common species were Common Tern Sterna hirundo, Laughing Gull Leucophaeus atricilla, and Royal Tern Thalasseus maximus. In the coastal area, the most common species were Laughing Gull, Royal Tern, and Cayenne Tern T. acuflavidus eurygnathus. The Magnificent Frigatebird Fregata magnificens was sighted in all habitats. Monthly presence/absence and associations of species were also analyzed. Our results underline the high species diversity of seabirds within the waters of French Guiana as well as the diverse uses of available habitats. Indeed, the region is not only a major nesting area, but also a major foraging area for wintering, summering, and migrating species.

Even though they are a result of human decision-making processes aiming to change human behavior, many MPAs have neglected the human dimension and therefore failed to accomplish their goals. Thus, taking into account local community perceptions would undoubtedly contribute to MPAs success and durability. This paper has been focused on assessing fishermen‟s perception of the projected marine protected area “Jabal Moussa” situated in northern Morocco and overlooking the strait of Gibraltar. The survey was conducted with 99 fishermen in the three fishing sites of this area. Results showed reluctance towards the idea of implementing a MPA. The majority of fishermen illustrated that the implementation of this MPA would lead to a decrease in catches and an increase in costs and charges if some fishing grounds were closed. Compensatory measurements would be an alternative to this loss. Fishermen affirmed that the projected MPA should be managed conjointly with local cooperatives and associations according to a co-management approach to reach its goals. This approach could avoid conflicts likely to occur during the creation and post-creation of the future MPA. For the success of the projected MPA, authorities/fishermen meetings should be organized to discuss the fears, benefits, incentives, expectations, mode of governance, zonation, etc… In this context, it is possible to move towards better management of the MPA, balancing the conservation of the marine ecosystem and the well-being of fishermen. © 2022, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

Zonation 4GUI was used to evaluate the adequacy of current PAs and to strategically expand PAs while maximizing the coverage of target species and considering ecological integrity and socioeconomic activities. The results show that significant habitat degradation has occurred across 77.9% of the basin. The current PAs cover 6.3% of the site and represent 8.7% of the total distribution of key species. With regards to the threshold of protection of 30% of the area, protecting an additional 27.2% of the site under an ecological integrity prioritization scenario and a scenario of the socioeconomic costs involved in iteration would cover 93.5% and 80.4% of the ranges of the key species, respectively.

Among them, land snails are a main component of terrestrial ecosystems and they play a pivotal role in ecosystem functioning. They are suffering habitat loss, overexploitation and competition from introduced species, but are regarded as a “non-charismatic” group for conservation purposes. Orthalicoidea is a dominant faunal element in the Neotropics and in Argentina includes 104 species that inhabit a variety of environments. Their abundance, diversity, comprehensive taxonomy and widespread representation in different ecoregions makes this molluscan group an excellent model for biodiversity assessments. The database used here consisted of 985 unique geographic records of 104 species. Species distribution models were generated using the Maximum Entropy method and Zonation v 3.1 was used to evaluate the proposed conservation goals. Three analyses including species distributions, the current protected areas system (PAs) and the Human print layer were carried out. This allowed the identification of priority areas for conservation, the percentage of the species distribution under PAs and analysis of the potential impacts under current land use and in the priority areas detected above. Sixty-one species were modeled, and 59 of them were included in the priority area selection process due to their high area under curve (AUC) scores. Five high priority areas located in the different ecoregions, were identified: 1-dry Chaco, 2-humid Pampas, 3-Southern Andean Yungas, 4-Alto Paraná Atlantic Forests and 5-high Monte. A small percentage of the average distribution range of Orthalicoidean species (3%) was within the current protected areas. Highest-ranked priority areas for land snails are outside the current protected areas system. When human impact is considered, the priority areas are reduced in size and appear as small patches. However, highest priority areas for conservation continue being those detected in the above analyses. Most of the areas detected are used for economic purposes, creating conflicts of interest between the development of human activities and conservation. This study represents one of the first attempts to identify ecoregion level priority areas for a terrestrial invertebrate group. Further analyses, including new predictors and other molluscan taxa, would improve planning the conservation of poorly known invertebrate groups. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Mollusca; Orthalicoidea; Protected areas; Species distribution modelling; Zonation","Argentina; Invertebrata; Mollusca; Orthalicoidea; Stylommatophora; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; maximum entropy analysis; population distribution; prioritization; protected area; snail; species conservation; zonation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068449364"

For PAs that are established to conserve mobile species, it is important to cover all the key areas regularly used by these species. However, zonation and boundaries of PAs have often been established with limited knowledge of animal movements, leaving the effectiveness of some PAs doubtful. We used radio tracking data to evaluate the extent to which two coastal PAs in mainland China encompassed the full range of habitats used by migratory shorebirds during non-breeding seasons. The core zone (highest restriction on human activities) of the Yalu Jiang Estuary National Nature Reserve (Liaoning) incorporated only 22 ± 6% (n = 34) of the diurnal home range (95% kernel density) of the endangered great knots Calidris tenuirostris. In contrast, the core zone of Chongming Dongtan (Shanghai) incorporated 73 ± 24% (n = 25) of the home range of dunlins Calidris alpina. During high tide, great knots in Yalu Jiang mostly occurred in the experimental zone (least restriction on human activities) or sometimes outside the PA boundary altogether, where the birds could face substantial threats. By investigating satellite tracking records, consulting published literature, interviewing local experts and mapping habitat composition in different coastal PAs in China, we found that wet artificial supratidal habitats were frequently used by migratory shorebirds but the coverage of these habitats in coastal PAs was low. These PA boundaries and/or zonations should be revised to conserve mobile species more effectively. With the increasing number of tracking studies, analysing the spatial relationships between PAs and the movement ranges of mobile species can increasingly inform the development of a representative, comprehensive PA network. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","East Asian–Australasian flyway; Functional zone; Movement ecology; Tidal rhythm; Wader; Wetland","Australasia; China; Animalia; Aves; Calidris alpina; Calidris tenuirostris; animal community; conservation status; data set; endangered species; home range; migratory species; movement; nature reserve; protected area; wader; wetland","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063149862"

Models that combine species and environmental data, such as Gradient Forests (GF), provide one analytical approach to this problem, efficiently combining available information to produce spatial models of species turnover throughout an area of interest. Spatial estimates of species turnover can then be classified to estimate spatial patterns in species composition; however, the performance of GF-based classifications within a conservation planning context has not previously been evaluated. Here we assess the utility for conservation planning (using the software Zonation) of a GF-based hierarchical classification that summarises spatial patterns in demersal fish composition in the oceans around New Zealand. Progressively more complex Zonation analyses assessed the effects of (i) varying the number of classification groups, (ii) adding information describing species turnover, and (iii) adding information describing spatial variation in demersal fish species richness. The best-performing GF-based conservation ranking used layers describing the distributions of 30 classification groups, demersal fish species turnover between these groups, and species richness. Conservation outcomes from this ranking were only marginally less efficient than those from a more conventional ranking that used 217 individual species distribution layers (7% less efficient). This indicates that GF-based classifications may provide a practical alternative for marine conservation planning. Additional advantages arise from the greater ease with which a single classification layer summarising complex biodiversity patterns can facilitate decision-making in participatory stakeholder processes. © 2021 The Authors","Community classification; Demersal fish; Gradient forest model; Marine spatial planning; New Zealand; Species distributions; Zonation","New Zealand; Biodiversity; Conservation; Decision making; Fish; Forestry; Population distribution; Community classification; Conservation planning; Demersal fish; Gradient forest model; Marine Spatial Planning; New zealand; Species composition; Species distributions; Species turnover; Zonation; biodiversity; conservation planning; decision making; demersal fish; detection method; marine ecosystem; marine environment; spatial variation; stakeholder; Classification (of information)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113255472"

The reconnaissance of flora is presented, along with the analysis of the distribution of species, genera, and families within five (5) altitudinal zones. KedarnathWildlife Sanctuary which is situated in the Indian Himalayas harbours a rich variety of flora and fauna. The Himalayas are recognized for diverse vegetation distributed over a wide range of topographical conditions. Results: The analysis of diversity within five (5) altitudinal zones was carried out and a total of 324 plant species, representing 219 genera belonging to 92 families, were found. The dominant family was Asteraceae; the codominant family was Rosaceae, followed by Lamiaceae and Ranunculaceae. Eight (8) families were observed in all the altitudinal zones, while forty (40) families were observed in a single altitudinal zone, and the remaining forty-four (44) families were found in more than one (1) altitudinal zone. Most of the tree species were contagiously distributed, but a few of them were randomly distributed in all the altitudinal zones. The shrubs and herbs were contagiously distributed in all the altitudinal zones. The correlation analysis (P b 0.05) between altitude and number of species showed that altitude is negatively correlated with tree (r = -0.96), shrub (r = -0.61), and herb species (r = -0.20). As per the cluster analysis of tree layer, altitudinal zone - III (2450-2650 m) and altitudinal zone - IV (2900-3100 m) were found most similar. Altitudinal zone-V (3350-3550 m) was found to be dissimilar from the other zones for herbs. Conclusions: Although species composition varieswith altitude, but there is a complex relationship between species richness and altitudinal gradient. A decreasing pattern in both species richness and family richness for trees, shrubs and herbs, was recorded with increasing altitude. The predominant factors underlying this variability in plant species and biogeography appear to be climatic and specific to each taxonomic group. © 2020 Ecological Society of China.","Altitudinal zone; Distribution; Family; Flora; Sanctuary","India; Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary; Uttarakhand; Asteraceae; Lamiaceae; Ranunculaceae; Rosaceae; altitudinal zonation; biogeography; fauna; flora; geographical distribution; plant community; protected area; species diversity; species richness; taxonomy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086749003"

Our aim in this paper is to analyse the results, based on each of these tools, using Marxan, a mapping software to obtain a zonation of a protect area in Mediterranean central Italy . The management algorithms of protected areas are widely used to identify potential networks of natural reserves that meet pre-established ecological limits, such as the presence of a specific percentage of habitats or a specific number of populations, at the same time minimizing costs. The Marxan software was made for different habitat where fragmentation of natural patches are significantly lower than in the study area, but it show interesting and useful result also in this situation. Marxan is particularly useful to solve the problem of the minimum set, in which the aim is to identify, at the lowest possible cost, the areas in which the biodiversity preconditions identified are present. In this work the Circeo National Park (Central Italy) was analysed, as an example of the Mediterranean area. We elaborated, through Marxan a series of maps of the priority areas for conservation that can be used as a starting point working with all the stakeholders involved in the management of the area itself. The main information suggests is to take particular attention to seasonal variations in the composition of the bird communities and, consequently, to the weight that the Park assumes at national and international level in the context of migratory movements and biodiversity conservation. In addition, special attention must be paid to the growing of intensive, rapidly expanding agricultural activities that are not enough controlled and are potentially highly damaging for the Park's biodiversity, both in terms of vegetation and fauna. © 2019 Centro Italiano Studi Ornitologici.

While Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) has recently emerged as a promising tool for monitoring ecological states in marine environments, the specifics of how to apply this method remains poorly defined. In this study we examined how different combinations of sampling settings (frequency bandwidth, time of sampling (day/night), and sample duration) influenced the ability of two acoustic indices, the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) and the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), to discriminate different ecological states (ecostates) of coral reefs. We applied an iterative approach to select the most efficient and consistent combinations of sampling settings to use for these two acoustic indices, depending on the stability of their discriminating power across different time scales (successive days, moon phases, and seasons), and the minimum sampling effort required for reliable ecostate assessment. The ability of SPL and ACI to discriminate ecostate-specific soundscapes was more stable and required less sampling effort at nighttime. For indices calculated in the higher frequency band (>2 kHz), very short recording times (≤20 min divided into 5 s samples) were sufficient to discriminate ecostates, whereas longer recording times (≥200 min divided into 5 min samples) were necessary when using indices calculated in the lower frequency bands (<1 kHz). An optimised sampling scheme, i.e. the group of the five best combinations of settings to discern among coral reef ecostates, was determined at Reunion Island, Indian Ocean, then tested at New Caledonia, Pacific Ocean. Here, the classifications obtained through visual surveys and with the optimised acoustic sampling scheme were congruent. The concordance of our results with visual fish counts confirms the potential of ecoacoustics to rapidly and reliably characterise coral reefs’ ecostate, allowing managers to prioritise conservation areas among numerous sites, and detect ecological changes over time. Our study provides clear guidelines for monitoring soundscapes by means of the ecoacoustic indices most widely used in the marine realm. © 2019 The Authors","Coral reefs; Ecoacoustic indices; Ecological state (ecostate); Marine habitats; Passive Acoustic Monitoring; Sampling scheme","Anthozoa; Acoustic measuring instruments; Cost effectiveness; Iterative methods; Ocean habitats; Reefs; Coral reef; Ecoacoustic indices; Ecological state; Passive acoustic monitoring; Sampling schemes; acoustic method; coral reef; ecological zonation; habitat type; innovation; marine ecosystem; monitoring; optimization; protected area; sampling; Ecology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070773127"

However, baseline information of these areas is either inadequate or scattered due to various reasons. The 2,360 km long coast of North West India (NWI), is a heavily industrialized and urbanized zone. This coast with unique biogeographical and climatic features with two notified marine protected areas also supports rich biodiversity. This review was motivated by a need to construct a synoptic view on marine benthic ecology and functioning by consolidating available information of macrobenthos. Two thousand seventy-eight macrobenthic taxa belonging to 14 phyla were compiled from 147 references and were composed mostly by Polychaeta (n = 617), Gastropoda (n = 602), and Bivalvia (n = 216). Habitat wise, intertidal and subtidal zones were more intensely studied and contributed most to the diversity records. Sediment texture and salinity were the major drivers of macrobenthic community structure in the subtidal areas and estuaries, respectively. In the intertidal zones, zonation patterns related to the tidal levels and time of exposure were distinct with the high water zones being sparsely populated and lower intertidal zones sustaining higher species and functional diversities. All zones of NWI coast were distinctly impacted to various extent by anthropogenic activities affecting the resident macrobenthos. Decline in species richness and species substitution due to pollution were reported in urbanized zones. Non-monsoonal months favored a more conducive environment for the macrobenthic diversity and functionality. Hypoxia tolerant polychaete species mainly belonging to Spionidae and Cossuridae dominated during the low oxygen conditions of upwelling and OMZ zones of NWI. Inadequate identification and inconsistency of sampling methods were major deterrents for concluding trends of distributions. Suggestions for future macrobenthic research include focusing on lesser studied groups and areas, seasonal as well anthropogenic hypoxic zones and well planned long-term monitoring studies. Major data lacunae were identified in the taxonomy, molecular, functional aspects, and bioinvasive studies of macrobenthos in this geographical zone despite clear evidence of high diversity of extant macrofauna. This compendium should help prioritize research areas and objectives aimed at enhancing our understanding of macrobenthos and improve predictive capabilities of community shifts that may occur due to global climate change scenarios. © Copyright © 2021 Sukumaran, Vijapure, Mulik and Ridha.","biodiversity; functioning; India; macrobenthos; review","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112134396"

Galliformes is a globally endangered avian order vulnerable to climate change that provide an important indicator for wildlife conservation effectiveness. Here, we identified priority areas for conserving Galliformes taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity in China and their spatial dynamics subject to climate change, and examined how well existing protected areas align with current and future priority areas. Location: China. Methods: We applied species distribution modelling and Zonation algorithms to identify conservation priority area dynamics for 47 galliform species across three biodiversity indexes subject to three future climate change scenarios to 2050s and 2070s. We overlaid these identified priority areas onto existing national nature reserves and national parks to assess and project their effectiveness. Results: Current priority areas proved spatially incongruent between indexes, with an optimal area overlap comprising just 10.3% of China's land area, lying largely outside of existing protected areas. Furthermore, over 80% of modelled optimal priority areas currently lacked formal conservation status. Future priority areas will shift substantially under climate change, to an extent dependent on greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Nevertheless, we identified five large regions where optimal Galliformes diversity indexes should remain stable under all scenarios, thus providing potential climatic refugia, if protected from human encroachment. Main Conclusions: The current deficits we identified for Galliformes protection in China resonate with a broader need for hierarchical conservation strategic planning across regions and ecosystems to ensure long-term biodiversity protection, accommodating for climate change. © 2022 The Authors.

Hydrodynamic forces depend on the shape of the submerged body; streamlined shapes decrease drag forces compared with bluff or globose bodies. Unlike other animals, hermit crabs can choose their shell shape to cope with the effects of water flow. Hermit crabs occupy larger and heavier shells (conical shape) in wave-exposed sites than those used in protected areas (globose shape). First, we investigated whether a behavioral choice could explain the shells used in sites with different wave action. Then, we experimentally tested whether the shells most frequently used in sites with different wave action reduce the energetic cost of coping with water flow. Metabolic rate was measured using a respirometric system fitted with propellers in opposite walls to generate bidirectional water flow. The choice of shell size when a large array of sizes are available was consistent with the shell size used in different intertidal sites; hermit crabs chose heavier conical shells in water flow conditions than in still water, and the use of heavy conical shells reduced the energetic cost of coping with water motion. In contrast to conical shells, small globose shells imposed lower energy costs of withstanding water flow than large globose shells. The size and type of shells used in different zones of the rocky shore were consistent with an adaptive response to reduce the energetic costs of withstanding wave action. © 2020 Company of Biologists Ltd.

Biodiversity has often been used in spatial conservation planning and has been regarded as one among multiple services delivered by ecosystems. Hence, biodiversity conservation planning should be integrated in a framework of prioritizing services in order to inform decision-making. Here, we propose a prioritization approach based on scenarios maximising both the provision of ecosystem services and the conservation of biodiversity hotspots. Different weighting scenarios for the α-diversity in four taxonomic groups and 10 mapped ecosystem services were used to simulate varying priorities of policymakers in a mountain region. Our results illustrate how increasing priorities to ecosystem services can be disadvantageous to biodiversity. Moreover, the analysis to identify priority areas that best compromise the conservation of α-diversity and ecosystem services are predominantly not located within the current protected area network. Our analyses stress the need for an appropriate weighting of biodiversity within decision making that seek to integrate multiple ecosystem services. Our study paves the way toward further integration of multiple biodiversity groups and components, ecosystem services and various socio-economic scenarios, ultimately fuelling the development of more informed, evidence-based spatial planning decisions for conservation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation planning; Decision support tool; Economic valuation; Human-nature trade-off; Spatial prioritization; Zonation software; α-diversity","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091240062"

Spatial variability of amphipod species composition and functional traits were studied over a 3 year period during the summer season at five intertidal transects of the Gulf of Kachchh (GoK) MPAs, India. A total of 22,706 individuals, comprising 71 species belonging to 40 genera and 23 families, were identified. Aoridae, Dexaminidae, Eriopisidae, Lysianassidae, and Maeridae were the best represented families (68.2% of total abundance). Distinct spatial patterns in the amphipod assemblage structure and functional traits were observed along the horizontal and vertical axes. The results demonstrated that the amphipod assemblage functioning was greatly influenced by the vertical gradient, with generally higher functional diversity (FD) in the lower intertidal zones suggesting increased diversity in resource use strategies, whereas the upper zones showed very little FD possibly due to the prevalence of environmental filtering. As higher species and functional diversities promote better resource partitioning and resilience of the ecosystem, these results are important for the management of MPAs facing the dual challenges of global climate change and anthropogenic pressures. © Copyright © 2020 Srinivas, Sukumaran, Neetu and Ramesh Babu.","amphipod; functional traits; fuzzy coding; intertidal; Marine National Park; vertical zonation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096683541"

We developed a novel spatial prioritization model based on accurate estimates of remotely-sensed data and maps of threats potentially affecting long-term species persistence. We used this approach to identify priority areas for the conservation of the Endangered Greek meadow viper Vipera graeca, a cold-adapted species inhabiting mountaintops in the Pindos Mountains of Greece and Albania. We transformed the mapped threats into nine variables to estimate conservation value: habitat suitability (climate suitability, habitat size, occupancy, vegetation suitability), climate change (future persistence, potential for altitudinal range shift) and land-use impact (habitat alteration, degradation, disturbance). We applied the Zonation systematic conservation planning tool with these conservation value variables as biodiversity features to rank the areas currently occupied by the species and to identify priority areas where the chances for population persistence are highest. We found that 90% of current habitats will become unsuitable by the 2080s and that conservation actions need to be implemented to avoid extinction as this is already a threatened species with a narrow ecological niche. If threats are appropriately quantified and translated into variables of conservation value, spatial conservation planning tools can successfully identify priority areas for the conservation of single species. Our study demonstrates that spatial prioritization for single umbrella, flagship or keystone species is a promising approach for the conservation of species for which few data are available.

The other 798–801 species would experience range expansion. Compared to resident species (n = 516), migratory birds (n = 526) may undergo more limited range expansion but a longer range shift distance on average. The species diversity of birds will considerably increase in areas higher than 1,500 m in elevation under both RCPs. Conservation priorities with higher species richness were also identified using the Zonation model. The existing national nature reserves are not sufficient for protecting important bird habitats, especially after range shifts. Significant gaps in protected areas were observed in the northern Xinjiang, southern Tibet, Greater Khingan, Sanjiang Plain, Songnen Plain, northern Bohai Rim, and southeastern coastline areas. Many of these areas are characterized by high human populations and intensive development, and establishing sizable protected areas has become difficult. Inclusive conservation mechanisms that include restoring habitats in urban parks and sharing habitats in farmland areas, may be a feasible solution. Copyright: © 2020 Hu et al.

Land conservancies and government agencies are interested in identifying areas to protect populations, while some timber companies wish to manage forests to minimize impacts on CanadaWarbler and potentially create future habitat. We developed seven conservation planning scenarios using Zonation software to prioritize candidate areas for permanent land conservation (4 scenarios) or responsible forest management (minimizing species removal during forest harvesting while promoting colonization of regenerated forest; 3 scenarios). Factors used to prioritize areas included CanadaWarbler population density, connectivity to protected areas, future climate suitability, anthropogenic disturbance, and recent Canada Warbler observations. We analyzed each scenario for three estimates of natal dispersal distance (5, 10, and 50 km). We found that scenarios assuming large dispersal distances prioritized a few large hotspots, while low dispersal distance scenarios prioritized smaller, broadly distributed areas. For all scenarios, efficiency (proportion of current Canada Warbler population retained per unit area) declined with higher dispersal distance estimates and inclusion of climate change effects in the scenario. Using low dispersal distance scenarios in decision-making offers a more conservative approach to maintaining this species at risk. Given the differences among the scenarios, we encourage conservation planners to evaluate the reliability of dispersal estimates, the influence of habitat connectivity, and future climate suitability when prioritizing areas for conservation. © 2020 by the authors.","Bird distribution and abundance; Boreal birds; Canada warbler; Cardellina canadensis; Reserve design; Zonation","Canada; Aves; Cardellina; Wilsonia canadensis; abundance; bird; environmental planning; forest management; nature conservation; population distribution; songbird","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080936757"

Borneo and Sumatra host some of the richest assemblages of biota worldwide. The region, however, faces the highest global deforestation rates, which seriously threaten its unique biodiversity. We used a large camera trap dataset that recorded data for 70 terrestrial species of mammals and birds, to explore the drivers of regional species richness patterns. Using a multi-scale, multivariate modelling framework which quantified the main environmental factors associated with patterns of biodiversity, while simultaneously assessing individual relationships of each species, we determined the ecological drivers of sampled biodiversity, and their contributions to community assemblages. We then mapped predicted species richness, evaluated the effectiveness of protected areas in securing biodiversity hotspots, performed gap analysis to highlight biodiverse areas lacking protection and compared our predictions with species richness maps produced by using IUCN range layers. Finally, we investigated the performance of each species as an indicator of sampled biodiversity. We demonstrate that biodiversity in Borneo and Sumatra is primarily affected by gradients of ecological and anthropogenic factors, and only marginally by topographic and spatial factors. In both islands, species are primarily associated with elevational gradients in vegetation and climate, leading to altitudinal zonation in niche separation as a major factor characterizing the islands' biodiversity. Species richness was highest in north-eastern Borneo and in western Sumatra. We found that most predicted biodiversity hotspots are not formally protected in either island; only 9.2 and 18.2% of the modelled species richness occurred within protected areas in Borneo and Sumatra, respectively. We highlighted that our prediction for Borneo performed better than, and differed drastically from, the IUCN species richness layer, while for Sumatra our modelled species richness layer and the IUCN one were similar, and both showed low predictive power. Our analysis suggests that common and generalist carnivores are the most effective indicators of sampled biodiversity and have high potential as focal, umbrella or indicator species to assist multi-species vertebrate conservation planning. Understanding existing drivers and patterns of biodiversity is critical to support the development of effective community conservation strategies in this rapidly changing region. © 2022 The Authors.

In Indonesia, land spatial planning has firstly been implemented, followed by the spatial zonation of coastal waters. Therefore, to achieve sustainable coastal zone management, the harmonization between the regional spatial plan or RTRW with the zoning plan for coastal waters and small islands or RZWP3K is urgently needed. This paper aims to examine the spatial problems in the process of integrating these two spatial plans. Using the spatial review method, the stages of study consist of forming the seamless spatial planning maps of 8 provincial regions in Indonesia that have stipulated the second regional regulation on spatial planning regimes and then integrated them with the coastal waters spatial planning zonation map (rzwp3k). The findings show the potential conflict in some areas, especially in protected areas with cultivation and public use, and between the cultivation areas, fisheries, and industries. Other findings are on the technical aspect, which shows the differences in the coastal area due to the use of two different coastlines and base maps. Regarding substance, there are differences in the content of the framework of the RTRW and RZWP3K mandates in regional regulation.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Coastal engineering; Conservation; Regional planning; Zoning; Coastal development; Coastal zone management; Marine Spatial Planning; Potential conflict; Protected areas; Spatial planning; Spatial problems; Technical aspects; Coastal zones","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107217698"

Location: From central Mexico to southern Panama. Methods: We selected 180 bird species that are geographically restricted to Mesoamerica and estimated their potential ranges using species distribution models. Then, using two different removal rules in ZONATION software, we assessed the species’ representativeness levels within the current PA network. We also defined forest remnants that could be used to strategically expand PAs (to reach Aichi biodiversity targets) and maximize the species protection, explicitly considering anthropic pressures. Results: Current PAs cover ~13% of the land area of Mesoamerica, representing an average of ~19% of the total potential distribution for the endemic bird species considered. We also observed that there is <30% overlap between current PAs and the priority areas we define. Our prioritization analyses showed that strategically increasing protection coverage to 17%, as stipulated in the Aichi targets, would substantially increase the representativeness values of PAs (regardless of the removal rule used) and would increase the range by >35% for all species and >29% for threatened species. The consensus priority conservation areas identified were mainly distributed in Costa Rica (~48%), Mexico (~28%), and Panama (~10%). Main conclusions: Consistent with the global picture, Mesoamerican PAs showed low representativeness of their vulnerable endemic avifauna; therefore, well-informed decisions to guide conservation strategies are imperative. We provide insights about where future conservation efforts should focus to accomplish a representative and well-connected regional PA network. © 2020 The Authors.

Since richness is not the best framework to conserve biodiversity, ecologists have been using patterns of complementarity to ensure that sites selected for inclusion in a reserve network complement those already selected. They also have investigated their association with the environment to conserve biodiversity in terrestrial realms successfully. In this study, we extended these ideas to marine realms. Specifically, we investigated if complementarity patterns vary with latitude, and what are the reasons for the observed patterns. Location: Global. Time period: Present day. Major taxa studied: Marine mammals. Methods: Global distribution maps for 123 marine mammals were obtained from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Spatial Database to determine the global presence/absence of species. Random forest models were used to investigate the relationship between oceanographic variables and patterns of complementarity-based marine mammal site importance, calculated using the software Zonation. Results: Complementarity maps for all marine mammal species show a gradient of increasing importance from pelagic towards coastal areas, with patches of high priority in the Southern, North Pacific, and Arctic Oceans. Conversely, maps depicting hotspots of richness (HRs) of marine mammals show that HRs are highly biased towards tropical zones. Random forests identified temperature, bathymetry and salinity as the critical drivers of high conservation priority for marine mammals at a global extent. Main conclusions: Our results support the tenet that site complementarity can be modelled and predicted as a function of environmental variables. Because marine mammals face a higher level of threats compared to their land counterparts, our results can help stakeholders and citizens to advocate for actions in priority areas. Also, complementarity patterns could provide important insight into how patterns might change in the future, given the impacts of climate. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","complementarity; conservation biogeography; marine mammal biogeography; oceanographic variables; species richness; surrogates of biodiversity","Mammalia; biodiversity; biogeography; complementarity; marine mammal; protected area; species richness; surrogate method","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091254974"

This paper is focused on a systematic analysis of the modern pollen–vegetation relationship in three protected areas of the Puna in Jujuy, northwestern Argentina. Vegetation assemblages were described on the basis of their floristic composition in 32 plots. Different multivariate methods, indices of association and simple linear regression models were applied in order to investigate the degree to which the different vegetation assemblages can be distinguished by their pollen spectra. Five plant assemblages were described, which were partially represented by their pollen spectra: mixed and shrubby steppes, scrubland, grassland with shrubs and high Andean grassland. The pollen spectra reflected both altitudinal variations and environmental conditions. In the Puna belt, at 3600 m, shrubs were present in great abundance and their highest pollen percentages were recorded. Both the abundance of Poaceae herbs and their pollen type increased with increasing altitude up to 4220 m, indicating the transition towards the Altoandean belt. Pollen assemblages evidenced the following environmental conditions: (1) the temperature decrease is characterized by taxa adapted to either cold air (<7 °C) or cold soil (Aridisols-Cryids/Inceptisols-Ustepts type) including Poaceae, Frankenia triandra, Apiaceae, Hoffmansegia glauca, Ephedra, Caryophyllaceae; (2) moisture availability in the soil can be discernible by assemblages indicating dry soil (Aridisols-Durids type), such as Baccharis, Fabiana densa, Maihuniopsis boliviana, Fabaceae, Tetraglochin cristatum and Nassauvia axilaris, from those indicating humid soil (Entisols-Psaments type), such as Parastrephia, Astragalus garbancillo and Gentianaceae. Four taxa exhibited both a good association and a significant correlation and could be considered indicative of the steppe (Baccharis and M. boliviana), scrublands (Parastrephia) and grassland (Poaceae) in a fossil record.

Although the importance of comprehensive approaches to deal with anthropogenic litter pollution is acknowledged, integrated studies including geomorphologic, biotic, and anthropic factors in relation to beach debris accumulation are still needed. In this perspective, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) might represent an appropriate tool to predict litter accumulation probability in relation to environmental conditions. In this context, we explored the applicability of a SDM–type modelling approach (a Litter Distribution Model; LDM) to map litter accumulation in coastal sand dunes. Starting from 180 litter sampling plots combined with fine–resolution variables, we calibrated LDMs from litter items classified either by their material type or origin. We also mapped litter accumulation hotspots. LDMs achieved fair-to-good predictive performance, with LDMs for litter classified by material type performing significantly better than models for litter classified by origin. Accumulation hotspots were mostly localized along the beach, by beach accesses, and at river mouths. In light of the promising results achieved by LDMs in this study, we conclude that this tool can be successfully applied within a coastal litter management context. © 2021 by the authors.

These mountains contain high biodiversity and several endemic species, but the current Natural Protected Areas network covers a low area of ​​0.12 %. In this work, we modelled the geographic distribution of reptiles in the Tandilia Mountains to: a) explore the environmental factors affecting the distribution of reptiles on the highland grasslands of the Tandilia Mountain System and (b) identify the key biodiversity areas. We used ten environmental variables and several sources of records (fieldwork, scientific literature, museum collections, and an online database) to model the distribution of each reptile species. The best sites to propose natural reserves were determined in Zonation software. We determined the representativeness of the current system of Natural Protected Areas in the Tandilia Mountain range by overlapping the sites with the Zonation results. We obtained 20 species distribution models with two general patterns: continuous and patched.

However, to date, few studies on ichthyoplankton in the Philippine Sea have been conducted. During the summer, autumn, and winter of 2020–2021, a series of investigations were conducted to study the spatial and temporal structure of fish larvae in the Philippine Sea. A total of 65 samples were collected by vertical hauling from a depth of 200 m to the surface. A total of 882 fish larvae representing 81 distinct taxa, 49 genera, and 23 families were identified. A seasonal pattern was also observed based on the differences in abundance and dominant taxa. The abundance of fish larvae was 11.35 ± 12.46 ind./100 m3 (mean ± sd.) in summer, 5.83 ± 7.03 ind./100 m3 in autumn, and 2.57 ± 2.73 ind./100 m3 in winter. The dominant species were Vinciguerria nimbaria, Encrasicholina punctifer, and Cyclothone sp. in summer, V. nimbaria, and Ceratoscopelus warmingii in autumn, and Diaphus spp., D. garmani, and Sigmops sp. in winter. A significant latitudinal variation in fish larvae assemblages was found via cluster analysis, and two geographic groups were separated by the northern boundary of the North Equatorial Current. In addition, the fish larvae species diversity also showed a significant latitudinal gradient in autumn, which disappeared in summer. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the structure of fish larvae assemblages was affected by average temperature, salinity, and net primary productivity in the upper ocean and sea level anomaly. All dominant species were associated with specific niche environments. This study suggests that latitudinal zonation of fish larvae also occurs in the oligotrophic low latitude Pacific Ocean and is enhanced in autumn. These results provide multi-seasonal baseline data of fish larvae assemblage in the upper Philippine Sea, being an important reference for the planning of marine protected areas in the high seas.

As the zonal steppe ecosystems are totally destroyed and transformed, petrophytic cenoses represent the predominant type of natural vegetation. They are of high conservation importance due to preserving unique biodiversity with a large number of rare and endangered species, relics and endemics (Ryabinina, 2003; Yamalov et al., 2019). Stony steppes in the Southern Urals have been studied for more than 100 years. Initiated in the 1980s, the syntaxonomical research covers now only the limited territories, mainly within the protected areas (Unikalnye ..., 2014; Prirodnye ..., 2018). The recent studies are focused on the relationship between the petrophytic vegetation and macroecological gradients in the context of geographical zonation (Zolotareva et al., 2019; Korolyuk et al., 2020). Our study presents the results of the analysis of 265 relevés of petrophytic communities of the steppe zone, carried out by the authors on the territory of the Gaysky, Kuvandyksky, Saraktashsky and Belyaevsky administrative districts of the Orenburg region, as well as the Khaibullinsky district of the Bashkortostan Republic in 2014–2018 (Fig. 1). Six phytocoenons were identified using the TWINSPAN algorithm followed by manual sorting. They represent the main diversity of petrophytic vegetation in the studied region and differ in the groups of species identified by formal criteria (Korolyuk et al., 2016; Zolotareva et al., 2019). We conducted the cluster analysis to compare these with the petrophytic associations of the Urals: 26 associations from the classes FestucoBrometea Br.Bl. et Tx. ex Soó 1947 and Anabasietea cretaceae Golovanov et al. 2021 (Fig. 2, 3). Five communities were assigned to the steppe vegetation, and their position in the syntaxonomical system was determined. Communities 1–3 regarded as typical steppes have similar floristic composition and dominant plants; community 4 is closer to the rich forbbunchgrass steppes; community 5 and the ass. Anthemido trotzkianae–Thymetum guberlinensis have transitional features to desert steppes. We identified the new alliance Elytrigion pruiniferae all. nov.

Holotypus — the association Elytrigietum pruiniferae Lebedeva ass. nov. Alliance represents xeropetrophytic vegetation of the steppe zone of the South Urals. Its area covers the watersheds of the Sakmara, Ural and Ilek rivers. Its communities were also found on the right bank of the Sakmara river (the Guberlya and Kuragan basins), as well as in the lower part of the Bolshoy Ik river basin. The communities occupy convex slopes and tops of ridges with immature gravelly soils. In the southern part of the alliance distribution area, they are confined to slopes of various shapes and exposures, while in the northern part mainly to convex southern slopes or to the top of the ridges. The alliance represents xerophytic part of the order HelictotrichoStipetalia. It replaces the more mesophytic alliance Helictotricho desertori–Orostachyion spinosae on the moisture gradient (Korolyuk, 2017). The alliance includes 3 associations and 1 community type. Ass.

The association is found mainly to the south of the latitudinal section of the Ural River within the Guberlinsky Uplands (Kuvandyk District), as well as of the hilly lands of the South Urals (Saraktashsky District). The communities are confined to slopes of different exposure and steepness on outcrops of sedimentary rocks. The plants of dry and desert steppes, as well as those preferring chalk outcrops, are among the diagnostic species. This brings the association together with desertsteppe communities of the order Agropiretalia Korolyuk et Laktionov 2021, class Artemisietea lerchianae Golub 1994 (Korolyuk, Laktionov, 2021). Nevertheless, the composition and structure of cenoses confirm the assignment of the association to the class FestucoBrometea.

We build models using MaxEnt for Egyptian medicinal plants as a model system, projecting them to different future times under two IPCC 4th assessment emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) assuming unlimited and no dispersal. We compare the effect of two indices of socioeconomic activity [Human Influence Index (HII) and human population density/km2] as cost layers in spatial prioritization for conservation using zonation. We assess the efficacy of Egypt's network of Protected Areas (PAs) by comparing the predicted conservation value inside and outside each PA under the various scenarios. The results show that there are many locations in Egypt (the main cities, agricultural land, coastal areas) that are highly ranked for conservation before human socioeconomic impacts are included. The HII had a stronger impact than using human population density. The PA value excess (inside–outside) varied significantly with the type of cost and dispersal, but not with climate-change scenario or Zonation settings. We conclude that human socioeconomic impacts add new scope and insights for future conservation; and conservation planning without consideration of such impacts cannot be complete. © 2019, © 2019 Societá Botanica Italiana.","conservation planning; Egypt; plants; Socioeconomic impact; species distribution models; Zonation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066603194"

Impact avoidance via appropriate site selection is the most effective means for preventing or alleviating damage from wind energy. Appropriate site selection requires a knowledge of landscape priorities. Here, we used a Spatial Conservation Prioritisation software to identify priority areas for bird conservation in relation to onshore wind energy in Finland, providing spatial guidance for impact avoidance at the national level. We showed that high bird priority areas are mainly concentrated in coastal and adjacent areas, thus entailing marked regional differences and responsibilities. Only a fraction of high priority areas (e.g., 15 % of 10 % top priority areas) is under some level of protection, indicating that the network of protected areas should be expanded to safeguard sensitive species. We found that the west coast, in particular, concentrates potential conflicts between birds and wind energy due to the co-occurrence of high priority areas and extensive wind energy development regionally. Thus, focusing conservation action away from areas already extensively targeted by wind energy cannot meet the conservation needs of many sensitive species, some of which occur exclusively or mainly in coastal areas. We recommend that birds be protected by avoiding construction in high priority areas and conducting careful spatial planning in coastal and potentially high conflict areas. Our results can contribute to bird conservation schemes, while addressing the pressing issue of biodiversity protection in the context of energy transition. © 2022","Biodiversity; Human-wildlife conflicts; Renewable energy; Spatial planning; Zonation","Finland; biodiversity; habitat loss; landscape ecology; site selection; spatial planning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144321207"

Much controversy has arisen surrounding this decision as the new category allows forest harvesting practices in most of the natural protected area. We assessed the forest cover loss in the Nevado de Toluca protected area and a 20 km buffer zone around it, before and after the change in protection status, and we established a map of forest types in view of assessing biodiversity vulnerability to the protection change in the forest harvesting areas. The forest type classification was carried out applying a Random Forest algorithm to Sentinel-2 imagery. The forest cover loss was assessed using the Landsat-based Global Forest Watch product during the period 2001–2019. Forest cover loss increased after the change of the Nevado de Toluca protection status; 39.7 hectares/year (± 16.7 ha/year) between 2001 and 2013 versus 106.0 hectares/year (± 40.2 ha/year) between 2014 and 2019.

Also, forest cover loss around the natural protected area has increased, especially in 2018, indicating that allowing forest harvesting practices in the natural protected area has not reduced the pressure in the surrounding forests either.

We then assessed the performance of the existing PA network relative to land exploitation pressure and evaluated conservation effectiveness of PA expansion for the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The Zonation software was used to spatially prioritize conservation areas to minimize biodiversity loss and the extinction risk for 8077 Japanese vascular plant and vertebrate species under constraints of the existing PA network and land use. The spatial pattern of the identified priority areas, which were considered candidate areas for expansion of the current PA network, was influenced by land-use types according to the mask layers of non-PAs, and low-, middle-, and high-ranked PAs. The current PA network reduced the aggregate extinction risk of multiple species by 36.6%. Indeed, the proportion of built-up areas in the existing PAs was generally smaller than that in the areas surrounding PAs. Notably, high-ranked PAs effectively restricted the built-up pressure (0.04% every 10 years), whereas low-ranked PAs in national park and wild-life protection areas did not (1.8% every 10 years). Conservation effects were predicted to substantially improve by expansion of high-ranked (legally strict) PAs into remote non-PAs without population/socioeconomic activities, or expansion of medium-ranked PAs into satoyama which have traditionally been used for agriculture and forestry, and urban areas. A 30% land conservation target was predicted to decrease extinction risk by 74.1% when PA expansion was implemented across remote areas, satoyama, and urban areas; moreover, PA connectivity almost doubled compared with the existing PA network. In contrast, a conventional scenario showed that placing national parks in state-owned and non-populated areas would reduce extinction risk by only 4.0%. Conservation prioritization analyses demonstrated the effectiveness of using a comprehensive conservation approach that reconciles land-sparing protection and land-sharing conservation in other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) in satoyama and urban green spaces. Our results revealed that complementary inclusion of various PA interventions related to their governance and land-use planning plays a critical role in effectively preventing biodiversity loss and makes it more feasible to achieve ambitious conservation targets. © 2021","Connectivity; Land sharing/sparing; OECM; Satoyama; Spatial prioritization; Zonation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114143071"

Therefore, how to formulate scientific partitioning strategies for both regional socio-economic development and ecological protection has become a key issue. Aimed at maintaining and improving regional sustainability, we established a partitioning indicator system of China considering 19 value indicators. We constructed the separate sets of the ecological values and economic-development values layers. Based on these two categories, China is classified into four types of functional areas, which are defined as key protected area, development area, low-tension area and conflict area. Finally, the Zonation model was used to identify the important regions of ecological sublayers, then these regions were overlapped with the conflict area to identify the key regions in conflict status which need more attention for ecological sustainability. The main research results are as follows: The ecological situation is generally better in southern China, while the development degree is higher in eastern China. The partitioning map shows that key protected areas mainly distributed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and parts of northeast China, and the existing nature reserves can protect most of the high-value regions of protected areas. In addition, most of the land in southeast China is identified as conflict areas. Though only 12% of high-quality habitats identified by Zonation are located in conflict areas, but nearly one-third of these habitats are in extreme-conflict status. The research results can provide a scientific basis for decision-making agencies to optimize regional ecological value and socio-economic benefits for regional sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH","Conflict area; Ecological protection; Economic development; Partitioning method; Zonation model","China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; development indicator; economic development; environmental protection; protected area; regional development; sustainability; urbanization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127199673"

In the current context of habitat loss and fragmentation, a network of protected areas is paramount for the conservation of this species. We aimed to identify jaguar conservation units in the Cerrado, and propose a ranking of priority areas for the species in this region. We used the maximum entropy algorithm to model habitat suitability for the jaguar in the Cerrado, with nine uncorrelated environmental variables and 106 non-autocorrelated presence-only records. We prioritized regions, using Zonation, and ranked jaguar conservation units according to their area, proximity to strictly protected areas, jaguar presence, and potential for connectivity. Circa 30% of the Cerrado is suitable for the jaguar. The most important variables affecting jaguar distribution are mean rainfall and land cover, with a high probability of jaguar presence in forest and savannah. We selected 31 high-priority jaguar conservation units, covering c. 174,825 km2 (8.5%) of the Cerrado. We emphasize the need for new protected areas and the promotion of sustainable development, as only 0.4% of the Cerrado (8,345 km2) has high environmental suitability for jaguars and < 1% of the area covered by jaguar conservation units falls within protected areas. Most jaguar conservation units identified here are relevant for habitat connectivity in Brazil, given their proximity to other critical areas for jaguar conservation in the Caatinga and the Amazon.

We quantified the sensitivity of an SCP application (using software Zonation) to possible sources of uncertainty in data-poor situations, including the use of different surrogate options; correction for sampling bias; how to integrate connectivity; the choice of species distribution modelling (SDM) algorithm; how cells are removed from the landscape; and two methods of assigning weights to species (red-list status or prediction uncertainty). Further, we evaluated the effectiveness of the Egyptian protected areas for conservation, and spatially allocated the top priority sites for further on-the-ground evaluation as potential areas for protected areas expansion. Results: Focal taxon (butterflies, reptiles, and mammals), sampling bias, connectivity and the choice of SDM algorithm were the most sensitive parameters; collectively these reflect data quality issues. In contrast, cell removal rule and species weights contributed much less to overall variability. Using currently available species data, we found the current effectiveness of Egypt's protected areas for conserving fauna was low. Conclusions: For SCP to be useful, there is a lower limit on data quality, requiring data-poor countries to improve sampling strategies and data quality to obtain unbiased data for as many taxa as possible. Since our sensitivity analysis may not generalise, conservation planners should use sensitivity analyses more routinely, particularly relying on more than one combination of SDM algorithm and surrogate group, consider correction for sampling bias, and compare the spatial patterns of predicted priority sites using a variety of settings. The sensitivity of SCP to connectivity parameters means that the responses of each species to habitat loss are important knowledge gaps. © 2020 The Author(s).","Data-poor countries; Protected areas; Sampling bias; Spatial conservation prioritisation; Species distribution models; Zonation","Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Reptiles; Egypt; Mammalia; Papilionoidea; Reptilia; connectivity; data quality; fauna; habitat loss; protected area; quantitative analysis; sensitivity analysis; spatial analysis; species conservation; animal; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental protection; reptile","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087157532"

In this study, we investigate these threats and delineate priority areas for conservation by comparing current (1950–1999) with future (2080–2100) distribution predicted by climatic niche modelling. Distribution changes encompass centroid displacement of up to 1067 km, range contractions of up to 460 km2, and fragmentation into up to 29 populations. Some felids may expand their distribution by up to 1016 km2, which could facilitate the reconnection of isolated populations if appropriate management plans are implemented. The protected area network overlaps with just 5.85% of the current distribution of felids and would decline to 3.69% in the future scenario, necessitating an expansion of protected areas in areas of felids distribution.

Should a new approach to tourism and recreational zonation in protected areas accommodate a broader spectrum of nature-based tourism activities? Using naturism as a novel example, this form of tourism could be accommodated by applying spatial and temporal recreational zonation of protected areas and associated facilities. In the face of growing dependence on revenue from tourism, it is concluded that policies governing tourism in protected areas be revised. This revision should be transparent and uniform to generate predictable outcomes or decisions, irrespective of the personal biases, values or subjective judgements of decision-makers.

To provide a more technically robust foundation for tiger habitat conservation prioritization, we conducted a comprehensively empirical analysis based on a broadly collected occurrence dataset of tigers and their prey. We modeled tiger distribution by running an ensemble model integrating nine different algorithms. We found that the ensemble model performed well and outperformed any individual model regarding the discrimination ability. We used cumulative resistant kernel analysis to identify core habitats as with high predicted movement density and used factorial least-cost paths to model corridors among tiger occurrence locations. We found that core habitats for Amur tigers are distributed in three mountain areas, namely, eastern Wanda Mountain, southern Zhangguangcailing, and Laoyeling-Dalongling. We found significant protection gaps as existing protected areas only cover less than one-fourth of predicted core habitats, but this proportion will rise significantly with the establishment of the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park. Furthermore, we ranked spatial priorities for the expansion of the protected area network, simultaneously considering biological and socioeconomic dimensions under the Zonation framework.

In this paper we aimed to evaluate the multi-service nature of ecosystem services (ES) supply in the dunes of the Italian Adriatic coast within Natura 2000 (N2K) sites. We i) identified ES indicators and assessed the supply capacity (Climate regulation, Protection from wind and aerosol, Erosion regulation, Recreation and Tourism and Existence value of biodiversity) of natural dune ecosystems of European conservation concern; ii) upscaled this data to create an inventory of ES supply for all dune N2K sites in the study area; iii) explored the trade-offs among ES; and iv) summarized and spatially compared the overall multi-service value of the N2K sites. The study provides a method for quantifying the role of N2K sites in supplying benefits for our society. We found that the multi-service capacity of coastal dunes is uneven within sites and within administrative regions. This variability is related to both ecological (e.g. distribution, ecological integrity, extent and conservation status of dune habitats) and administrative (e.g. local implementation of the Habitats Directive) characteristics of the analysed area. ES are not coupled as several sites with high values for one ES show very low values for others. The results suggest that conservation actions should favour restoration of the natural dune zonation, since this underpins multi-service ES supply. The approach can distinguish regions with high ES values and regions where the paucity of protected areas represents a gap in ES supply, fact that offers an incentive to enhance the protection strategy but also suggests an urgent need to improve the N2K network by enlarging existent sites and including new ones. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adriatic coast; Coastal dunes; Conservation network; Ecosystem services assessment; Ecosystem services mapping; Habitats Directive","Adriatic Coast [Italy]; Italy; Mediterranean Coast [Italy]; Biodiversity; Conservation; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Adriatic; Coastal dune; Conservation actions; Conservation status; Ecological integrity; Ecosystem services; Habitats directives; Protection strategy; assessment method; beach; dune; ecosystem service; mapping; nature conservation; aerosol; article; biodiversity; climate; habitat; human; quantitative analysis; seashore; tourism; zonation; Ecosystems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062697172"

However, only .% of the area is under full protection, and given the ongoing decline of this biome there is an urgent need to expand the protected area network. The Endangered Caatinga howler monkey Alouatta ululata is almost endemic to the Caatinga, and is a potential umbrella species for the protection of its biodiversity. Using all available distribution data and our own surveys we applied Maxent and Zonation spatial modelling to identify the range of A. ululata, and priority conservation areas for the species, maximizing habitat quality and connectivity, and minimizing conservation constraints. The top % priority areas cover , km and mostly coincide with good remnants of Caatinga. Only priority areas in the northern part of the species range are protected, so it is essential to create new protected areas in the centre and south of the range. Maxent modelling indicates that the species depends on good tree cover, but even inside protected areas we observed recent deforestation, illustrating the urgency to improve management.

The protection of A. ululata requires establishing new protected areas in priority locations and improving management of existing protected areas.

The coral reefs of Tamandaré-Brazil, located at Costa dos Corais marine protected area (MPA), encompass a mosaic of interconnected habitats of complex geomorphology, including coral reefs, algal, and seagrass beds. These coastal habitats are subjected to chronic impacts such as sedimentation, reef erosion, and increasing human use, leading to habitat loss. Despite their social and ecological importance and the conservation measures in place, bathymetric and habitat maps of this coast are lacking. Indeed, in situ surveys are not always feasible in shallow coral reef areas. The present study offers a detailed bathymetric mapping of the area using multiresolution satellite imagery. One Landsat-8 (December 2016) and one WorldView-03 (February 2017) imagery were used to derive medium (30-m) and high-resolution (2-m) bathymetry of the study area. Single-beam echo sounder surveys were performed to obtain field data to calibrate the depth-retrieving algorithms: linear model, ratio band model, principal component analyses of the transformed bands, and geographically weighted regressions (GWR). For both resolution datasets, results showed that the algorithms' RMS were significantly improved by the GWR technique (RMS > 0.9) because of adaptability to the bottom heterogeneity found in complex areas such as coral reefs. Specific geomorphological reef zones were recognizable in the resulting bathymetric maps, such as intrareef lagoon, reef crest, fore-reef, and reef flat. This research concluded that affordable methods such as single-beam data coupled with satellite imagery through GWR can provide the required inputs for mapping shallow areas with complex relief. Such results may be further used to habitat mapping, necessary to inform the multiple-use zonation foreseen in MPA management plans. © ","coastal reef; geographically weighted regression; heterogeneous; high resolution; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite imagery; single beam; tropical; WorldView","Brazil; algorithm; anthropogenic effect; bathymetry; coastal zone; coral reef; echo sounder; habitat loss; habitat type; marine park; satellite imagery","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088955671"

Systematic conservation planning (SCP) aims to improve the efficiency of biodiversity conservation, particularly when addressing internationally agreed protection targets. We apply SCP in Great Britain (GB) using the widest taxonomic coverage to date (4,447 species), compare spatial prioritisation results across 18 taxa and use projected future (2080) distributions to assess the potential impact of climate change on PA network effectiveness. Priority conservation areas were similar among multiple taxa, despite considerable differences in spatial species richness patterns; thus systematic prioritisations based on indicator taxa for which data are widely available are still useful for conservation planning. We found that increasing the number of protected hectads by 2% (to reach the 2020 17% Aichi target) could have a disproportionate positive effect on species protected, with an increase of up to 17% for some taxa. The PA network in GB currently under-represents priority species but, if the potential future distributions under climate change are realised, the proportion of species distributions protected by the current PA network may increase, because many PAs are in northern and higher altitude areas. Optimal locations for new PAs are particularly concentrated in southern and upland areas of GB. This application of SCP shows how a small addition to an existing PA network could have disproportionate benefits for species conservation. © 2022, The Author(s).","Bayesian occupancy modelling; Biodiversity; Habitat restoration; Spatial prioritisation; Species range shifts; Zonation","United Kingdom; biodiversity; habitat restoration; protected area; zonation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122690085"

In response, seabirds have adapted to move rapidly within and between ocean basins, making them important pelagic consumers. Studies in the Pacific, Southern and Indian Oceans have shown that seabirds are relatively abundant in major frontal systems, with species composition varying by water mass. In contrast, surprisingly little was known about seabird distribution in the oceanic North Atlantic until recent tracking showed that relative abundance and diversity peak in the Sub-polar Frontal Zone, west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, now proposed as a Marine Protected Area. However, absolute seabird abundance, distribution, age and species composition, and their potential environmental drivers in the oceanic temperate NW Atlantic remain largely unknown. Consequently, we systematically surveyed seabirds and environmental conditions across this area by ship in June 2017, then modelled the density of common species as functions of environmental covariates, validating model predictions against independent tracking data. Medium-sized petrels (99.8%), especially Great Shearwaters (Ardenna gravis, 63%), accounted for the majority of total avian biomass, which correlated at the macroscale with net primary production and peaked at the sub-polar front. At the mesoscale, the density of each species was associated with sea surface temperature, indicating zonation by water mass. Most species also exhibited scale-dependent associations with eddies and fronts. Approximately 51, 26, 23, 7 and 1 % of the currently estimated Atlantic populations of Cory's Shearwaters (Calonectris borealis), Great Shearwaters, Sooty Shearwaters (A. grisea), Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) and Leach's Storm-petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) occurred in the area during our survey, many of which were undergoing moult (a vital maintena nce activity). For some species, these estimates are higher than suggested by tracking, probably due to the presence of immatures and birds from untracked populations. Our results support the conclusion that MPA status is warranted and provide a baseline against which future changes can be assessed. Moreover, they indicate potential drivers of seabird abundance and diversity in the oceanic zone of the North Atlantic that should be investigated further. © 2021 The Authors","Distance sampling; Habitat model; Marine protected area; Mesoscale eddy; Procellariiformes; Shearwater","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northwest); Mid-Atlantic Ridge; Calonectris; Fulmarus glacialis; Hydrobatinae; Oceanodroma leucorhoa; Procellariidae; Procellariiformes; Conservation; Oceanography; Surface waters; Surveys; Biological production; Continental shelves; Environmental conditions; Habitat associations; Marine protected area; Net primary production; Sea surface temperature (SST); Species composition; abundance; habitat selection; net primary production; relative abundance; sea surface temperature; seabird; tracking; Population distribution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112692083"

Assessment of the carrying capacity of urban land is very important to evaluate and obtain an overview of the level of land capability through the classification of the carrying capacity of the area so that it becomes the basis for future urban development. This research was conducted in Palu City, which is national city in Indonesia with limited urban development due to its prone to earthquakes. For urban development, it is necessary to study the carrying capacity of land to reduce the risk of earthquake disasters, through three stages of analysis, namely mapping of earthquake-prone areas using the earthquake hazard mapping with seismic micro-zonation; land capability assessment; and integration of land suitability with planning and spatial planning of Palu City. Based on the findings of this study, 74.56% of Palu City is an earthquake-prone area dominated by land capability Classes A to B, namely low to very low land capability classes (55.43%), implying that they have urban physical constraints. However, if it is integrated with the Palu City spatial plan until 2030, most (78.79%) are already in accordance with the carrying capacity of their land, especially in protected areas, but there are still land developments that are not suitable for carrying capacity (21.21%), especially in cultivation areas with risks earthquake disaster. Land use plans that are not in accordance with their carrying capacity must be managed strictly as a tool for disaster mitigation that is urgently needed. © 2021 WULS - SGGW Press.

The Burdwood Bank (BB) is a submerged plateau (average depth 100 m) that constitutes the westernmost segment of the North Scotia Ridge (54°-55°S; 56°-62°W). The BB hosts rich benthic biodiversity in low chlorophyll waters of the southern Patagonian Shelf, Argentina, declared NamuncuráMarine Protected Area (NMPA) in 2013. So far, the pelagic microorganisms above the bank have not been described. During austral summer 2016, we assessed the microbial plankton (0.2-200 μm cell size) biomass and their taxonomical and functional diversity along a longitudinal transect (54.2-55.3°S, 58-68°W) from the Beagle Channel (BC) to the BB, characterized by contrasting hydrography. Results displayed a marked zonation in the composition and structure of the microbial communities. The biomass of phytoplankton >5 μm was 28 times higher in the BC, attributed mainly to large diatom blooms, than in oceanic waters above the BB, where the small coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and flagellates <10 μm dominated. In turn, the biomass of microheterotrophs above the BB doubled the biomass in the BC due to large ciliates. Notably, toxic phytoplankton species and their phycotoxins were detected, in particular high abundance of Dinophysis acuminata and pectenotoxins above the bank, highlighting their presence in open subpolar regions. Picophytoplankton (<2 μm), including Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes, were remarkably important above the BB, both at surface and deep waters (up to 150 m). Their biomass surpassed by 5 times that of phytoplankton > 5 μm, emphasizing the importance of small-sized phytoplankton in low chlorophyll waters. The homogeneous water column and high retention above the bank seem to favor the development of abundant picophytoplankton and microzooplankton communities. Overall, our findings unfold the plankton configuration in the Southern Patagonian Shelf, ascribed as a sink for anthropogenic CO2, and highlight the diverse ecological traits that microorganisms develop to adjust their yield to changing conditions. © 2020 Guinder et al.

Preserving the TOL is urgent, but has not been included in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Protected areas (PAs) are fundamental for biological conservation. However, we know little about the effectiveness of existing PAs in preserving the TOL of plants and how to prioritize PA expansion for better TOL preservation under future climate and land-cover changes. Here, using high-resolution distribution maps of 8732 woody species in China and phylogeny-based Zonation, we find that current PAs perform poorly in preserving the TOL both at present and in 2070s. The geographical coverage of TOL branches by current PAs is approx. 9%, and less than 3% of the identified priority areas for preserving the TOL are currently protected. Interestingly, the geographical coverage of TOL branches by PAs will be improved from 9% to 52-79% by the identified priority areas for PA expansion. Human pressures in the identified priority areas are high, leading to high cost for future PA expansion. We thus suggest that besides nature reserves and national parks, other effective area-based conservation measures should be considered. Our study argues for the inclusion of preserving the TOL in the post-2020 conservation framework, and provides references for decision-makers to preserve the Earth's evolutionary history.  © 2022 The Authors.","conservation priority; effectiveness; phylogenetic spatial prioritization; post-2020 framework; protected areas; tree of life","China; Geography; Humans; China; decision making; geographical region; land cover; national park; nature reserve; phylogenetics; prioritization; protected area; woody plant; zonation; China; geography; human","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143568168"

In addition to occurrences of species and habitats inside protected area candidate sites, one may also be interested about network-level connectivity considerations. Objectives: We applied SCP to the identification of ecological networks to inform the development of a new regional plan for the region of Uusimaa (South-Finland, including the Finnish capital district). Methods: Input data were 59 high-quality layers of biotope and species distribution data. We identified ecological networks based on a combination of a Zonation balanced priority ranking map and a weighted range size rarity map, to account for both relative and absolute conservation values in the process. We also identified ecological corridors between protected areas and other ecologically high-priority areas using the corridor retention method of Zonation. Furthermore, we identified candidate sites for habitat restoration. Results: We found seven large ecological networks (132–1201 km2) which stand out from their surrounding landscape in terms of ecological value and have clear connectivity bottlenecks between them. Highest restoration needs were found between large high-priority sites that are connected via remnant habitat fragments in comparatively highly modified areas. Conclusions: Land conversion should be avoided in areas of highest ecological priorities and network-level connectivity. Restoration should be considered for connectivity bottlenecks. Methods described here can be applied in any location where relevant spatial data are available.

Then, using ZONATION software, we assessed the role of existing protected areas (PAs) in determining the species’ representativeness and identified priority conservation areas where we expect species to persist in the face of these global threats. Overall, we estimated a general decrease in local species richness across ~ 41% of Yungas sites due to the effects of climate changes through the year 2050. Over 60% of species are forecasted to reduce drastically (more than 75%) their distributional ranges. Also, we observed a significant reduction (15.5%) in the proportion of PAs holding the potential distributional areas of species in new climate conditions. Therefore, well-informed decisions to guide conservation strategies are imperative. Our prioritization analyses showed that strategically increasing 0.7% the protection coverage (i.e. 17%, as stipulated in the Aichi targets) there are great opportunities for improving their conservation in the region, reaching on average the 19% of distributions for all species and 32.5% of those threatened and Data Deficient amphibians.

These species occupy different ecoregions: the Alto Paraná Atlantic forest, the Araucaria moist forest, the humid Chaco, the Southern Cone Mesopotamian savanna, the Paraná Ffooded savanna, and the Southern Andean Yungas. The recently approved National Primate Conservation Plan of Argentina calls for identifying priority areas to focus conservation actions for these species. We used species distribution models to estimate species ranges and then used the Zonation software to perform a spatial conservation prioritization analysis based on primate habitat quality and connectivity to identify potential areas of importance at national and ecoregional levels. Only 7.2% (19,500 km2) of the area inhabited by primates in Argentina is under protection. Outside the current protected areas, the top-ranked 1% and 5% priority areas identified in our analysis covered 1894 and 7574 km2, respectively. The top 1% areas were in the Atlantic forest of Misiones province, where S. nigritus, A. guariba, and A. caraya are distributed, and in the humid portion of eastern Chaco and Formosa provinces, where A. azarae and A. caraya are present. The top 5% areas included portions of the Yungas, where S. cay is the only primate present. Priority areas in Chaco and Formosa provinces are particularly relevant because of the paucity of protected areas and the high deforestation rate. The endangered A. guariba population will benefit from the better protection of the priority areas of Misiones. The potential priority areas proposed herein, considered within a context of a broad participatory process involving relevant stakeholders and local people, will help guide new and innovative conservation policies and practices while supporting management objectives. © 2022 by the authors.","Alouatta caraya; Alouatta guariba; Aotus azarae; Sapajus cay; Sapajus nigritus; spatial prioritization; species distribution models; Zonation","Araucaria; Argentina; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Chaco [Argentina]; Parana [Brazil]; Parana [Brazil]; Southern Cone; Yungas; ecoregion; population distribution; primate; prioritization; protected area; species conservation; zonation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149486715"

In tropical Africa, acute deficiency of scientific data on the distribution patterns of freshwater biodiversity hampers successful conservation interventions. The number of newly described and resurrected freshwater fish species in southern Africa has increased considerably since the last bioregionalization effort, nearly three decades ago. Here, we utilize an updated matrix of catchmentscale native freshwater fish distributions to re-evaluate earlier biogeographic zonation patterns and examine the relative contribution of beta diversity to observed spatial distribution patterns in the subregion. Cluster analysis applied to an incidence data matrix of 259 native freshwater fish species from 17 drainage basins resulted in three major biogeographic zones, which generally corresponded to patterns shown in earlier studies. However, our analysis further revealed a split of the Eastern zone into two sub-clusters - Northeast and Southeast. We decomposed the overall beta diversity (βSOR), of southern Africa’s native freshwater fishes into its nestedness (βSNE) and turnover (βSIM) components. In all three zones, the proportion of the nestedness resultant component (βratio) was less than 0.5, implying that the compositional variation in overall beta diversity was mainly driven by species turnover. The dominance of the turnover component to overall β-diversity suggests that conservation initiatives targeting multiple sites across broad spatial scales are likely to provide better outcomes for southern Africa’s native ichthyofauna than a few large, protected areas. We discuss the relative contribution of environmental heterogeneity and dispersal limitation on observed bioregionalization and β-diversity patterns of native freshwater fishes in southern Africa. Incomplete knowledge of the taxonomic diversity of southern Africa’s ichthyofauna affects the mapping of distribution patterns, stressing the need for increased sampling efforts, especially in high diversity drainages that border the Congo basin. © the authors, CC-BY 4.0 license","Africa; Biodiversity; Bioregionalization; Conservation; Drainage evolution; Fish distribution; River basins","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138124715"

In fact, the use of species distribution models as input allowed to create spatial decision-support maps. Of special interest are maps of potential biodiversity (MPB), which define distribution and ecological requirements of relevant species and maps of priority conservation areas (MPCA), which define priority areas considering endemism and richness. The objective of this paper was to assess multi-taxon biodiversity based on two different spatial analyses and to test their efficiency to support conservation decision at Patagonia. We computed 119 potential habitat suitability maps (one deer, birds, lizards, darkling-beetles, plants) with ENFA (Environmental Niche Factor Analysis) and 15 environmental variables, using Biomapper software. ENFA calculate two ecological indexes (marginality and specialization) which describe the narrowness of species niches and how extreme are the optimum environmental conditions related to the whole study area. These maps were combined obtaining a MPB and MPCA using Zonation software. Multivariate analyses were performed to compare methodologies, analysing environmental variables, ecological areas, forest types and protected areas. Multivariate and ecological indexes showed that deer, lizards and darkling-beetles presented a narrow range, while birds and plants presented a large range of marginality and specialization mainly related to vegetation and climate. At provincial level, highest potential biodiversity and conservation priority values were related to shrublands and humid steppes. However, MPCA showed higher values related to forests and alpine vegetation due to endemism, while MPB showed differences among forest types. These analyses showed that the most valuable areas were not represented in the protected areas, however, many higher conservation priority values were found inside the protected compared with unprotected areas. Different spatial decision-support maps presented similar outputs at provincial scale, but differed in the forest landscape matrix. Both methodologies can be used to plan conservation strategies depending on the specific objectives (e.g. highlighting richness or endemism). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biomapper; ENFA; Forest; Landscape level; Protected areas; Zonation","Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Deer; Ecosystem; Forests; Patagonia; assessment method; biodiversity; conservation planning; decision support system; environmental conditions; landscape planning; protected area; specialization; article; beetle; biodiversity; bird; climate; decision support system; factor analysis; habitat; landscape; lizard; nonhuman; scrub; software; spatial analysis; specialization; steppe; taxon; vegetation; zonation; animal; biodiversity; deer; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123372140"

Various methods for prioritizing conservation areas exist, yet alternative methods may direct managers to different lands for protection, and thus varying recommendations for meeting area-based targets. Here, we used bird species distribution models and landcover projections to systematically evaluate two widely used methods for prioritizing areas most likely to facilitate the persistence of multiple species under climate change: 1) in situ macrorefugia, identified as areas of high predicted species retention; and 2) complementarity-based optimizations, identified using the Zonation conservation planning software. For 17 biogeographical groups in the continental United States, we compared priority areas for bird conservation derived from these two alternatives with respect to their spatial distributions and consensus (i.e. overlap), expected conservation outcomes (e.g. species and functional diversity), predicted climate change exposure, habitat characteristics, landscape configurations and degree of formal protection. Spatial distributions of priority areas differed by biogeographical group and method, with 40.5% consensus on average across groups. Consensus was extensive within mountainous and coastal regions, and limited at high latitudes (e.g. Alaska) and in flat, interior regions (e.g. grasslands). As expected, complementarity-based optimizations more efficiently represented species than retention-based in situ macrorefugia, especially for forest groups, and had greater overall biodiversity value and better habitat condition. Conversely, in situ macrorefugia encompassed higher elevations and larger contiguous patches and were expected to experience less winter-season warming. Formal protection averaged < 50% across biogeographical groups, regardless of prioritization method. Our findings illustrate the value of complementarity-based optimizations for bird conservation under climate change. More broadly, comparing approaches for prioritizing areas for long-term species persistence can reveal critical trade-offs in recommendations for climate-informed protected area planning. © 2022 The Authors.

Information about the links between zoning and ecosystem services (ES) is lacking, particularly in terms of the relative roles of natural contributions (ecosystem properties and functions) and anthropogenic contributions (human inputs such as technology and infrastructure) in coproducing ES. This study aimed to: (1) analyse how coproduction of four ES (crop production, grazing, timber production, recreation) differs across the three zones of BRs; and (2) understand which predictors (zoning, natural and anthropogenic contributions, other environmental characteristics) best explain ES provision within BRs. To do this, we collected spatial data on 137 terrestrial BRs in the European Union and on 16 indicators of ES coproduction. We used non-parametric pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum tests to calculate differences in indicators between zones. We used model selection and multiple linear regression to identify predictors of ES provision patterns. Anthropogenic contributions showed most differences between zones, with contributions generally increasing from buffer zones to transition areas. Natural contributions did not, on average, differ between zones, however, for recreation and crop production they decreased from buffer zones to transition areas. ES provision differed between zones only for crop production and grazing, which increased from buffer zones to transition areas. Regression analysis showed that natural contributions are the best predictors of ES provision for all four services. Our results indicate that zoning of BRs has implications for ES coproduction. © 2021 The Author(s).

These spatial comparisons can be confounded if the habitat and reef size are dissimilar and not accounted for in the statistical analysis. Taking into account reef size (obtained from multibeam sonar data) and benthic habitat structure, this research tested the effect of management zonation (No-take Sanctuary Zone = NTSZ; Controlled Pelagic Zone = CPZ) on the population structure (relative abundance and average biomass) of six fish species in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, South Africa. Furthermore, this study tested the effect of ignoring reef size in spatial comparisons. Our results showed that reef size had a significant positive effect on the relative abundance and average biomass of most, but not all species. When reef size was included in the models, the results showed that two of the six species presented no effect of management zone; two appeared to be directly affected by the permitted (past and present) fishing activity in the CPZ; and the last two species appeared to be affected by the disturbance caused by the diving and/or boating activity in the CPZ. Excluding reef size from the analysis consistently resulted in the predicted relative abundance and average biomass decreasing in the CPZ and increasing in the NTSZ. This effect was most marked in the average biomass data, as the management zone effect changed from negligible to significant for five of the six species. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the reef size, or area of suitable habitat, when conducting spatial comparisons among species and illustrate the potential impact of the trade-off required to accommodate human needs within protected spaces. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coral reefs; Habitat area; MPA zonation; Stereo-BRUVs","iSimangaliso Wetland Park; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa; Anthozoa; Biomass; Conservation; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Fish; Fisheries; Information management; Population statistics; Wetlands; Coral reef; Fish population structure; Habitat area; Marine protected area; MPA zonation; Multi-beam sonar data; Population structures; Stereo-BRUVs; benthos; boating; conservation planning; coral reef; habitat structure; marine park; population structure; reef; spatial analysis; sport fishing; zonation; Reefs","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075540022"

At Lake Alaotra, conversion of marshland for rice cultivation and a lack of effective habitat protection have pushed the locally endemic Alaotra gentle lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis to the brink of extinction. The highest density of the species is found in the locally managed Park Bandro, a high-priority conservation zone within the Lake Alaotra New Protected Area. We evaluated local awareness and perceptions of Park Bandro, and discussed preferred management options with local communities. Two questionnaire surveys were carried out, one with 180 participants at six sites around the lake and marsh, and another with 50 participants in the village adjacent to Park Bandro. The majority of participants knew of the existence of Park Bandro but most did not know its purpose or size. Values and perceptions of local communities were influenced by occupation and distance to the Park, with fishers being most aware of the Park. We found that local people had a high level of environmental awareness and were willing to discuss zonation and alternative resource management strategies as long as these activities could provide a tangible livelihood benefit. Lack of awareness among local resource users regarding the purpose and status of protected areas such as Park Bandro is a challenge that needs to be addressed, and one that is relevant for environmental education and management of protected areas throughout Madagascar.

Here the suitable habitats of all of Trinidad and Tobago’s endemic plant species are determined and used to perform a gap analysis of a proposed protected area network. Data from a recently completed botanical survey, the WorldClim 2 environmental parameters, and a range of other sources were used to determine the habitat of each species using the species distribution model MaxEnt. Modelled habitat suitability for each species was combined and used to create maps showing endemic richness, weighted endemism and corrected weighted endemism, and to rank areas by conservation value using Zonation. The coverage of the proposed protected area network and a land use map were overlaid on these modelled distributions. We identified data limitations which meant that more than half of the 66 endemic species could not be modelled with confidence. For the remaining species, we found that the proposed protected area network contains just 13 ± 7% of the total modelled habitat of the endemic species. For eight endemic species > 25% of the suitable habitat is degraded. Model analysis indicated that elevation and temperature seasonality are the most important drivers of endemism. Based on a gap analysis the inclusion of high elevation areas of Trinidad’s Northern Range in the proposed protected area network would expand the coverage to include > 25% of the total modelled habitat of the endemic species, thus greatly increasing the long-term sustainability of the endemic species populations. © Springer Nature B.V. 2018.","Continental island; Endemism; Maxent; Protected areas; Species distribution model; Zonation","Trinidad and Tobago; Tracheophyta; biozonation; decision analysis; ecological modeling; endemic species; endemism; environmental degradation; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; habitat management; island; parameter estimation; protected area; software; species conservation; vascular plant","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048758737"

Today, the protected areas network (PAs) located within NDF covers <10% of the total forests' extent; and it's still unknown if PAs adequately represent its biodiversity. Thus, we selected 695 bird species associated to NDF and used ZONATION software to assess the species distribution's representativeness within the PAs network. Additionally, we defined priority conservation areas to strategically expand the current PAs considering the most important human pressures. Current PAs cover only 8.4% of NDF and represent on average ~10% of the total distribution of avifauna inhabiting these forests. Approximately 19% of NDF's birds possess <5% of their distribution represented in PAs, from which ~13% have <1% of their ranges protected. Further, ~77% of the most-priority species (i.e. with restricted range and categorized as threatened) possess <10% of their distribution protected. However, our results pointed out great possibilities to improve the picture. By considering our prioritization, the protection coverage would increase to 17% to match the Aichi targets and would substantially increase the representativeness values, covering on average >36% the ranges of all species and, particularly, 62% for the most-priority species. Priority conservation areas identified are mainly distributed in Peru (23.1%), Brazil (21.3%), Ecuador (18.8%), and Bolivia (11.4%).

Brazil experiences a combination of low and uneven protection of marine environmets, increasing anthropogenic pressures, climate change, and gaps in information regarding the geographical distribution of many species (Wallacean shortfall). Here, we addressed these issues and present a strategy for identifying priority marine areas for conservation in Brazil that would contribute to increasing species representation and achievement of conservation targets. Within this strategy, we accounted for (i) species range shifts due to climate change and their influence on species distribution, (ii) the lack of species geographical distribution data, and (iii) anthropic pressures on oceans. First, we built ecological niche models (ENMs) for 12 threatened starfish species in both present and future (2100) times using Maxent. We also quantified and mapped species range shifts. Second, we developed three conservation spatial solutions and compared the 10% top-ranked areas. The results showed that ENMs had a good performance in representing the distribution of species, even those that had few occurrence records. Our models forecasted a significant range expansion for the majority of species (10 out 12) by 2100. We found that the priority sites covering the top-ranked 10% in the study area identified in ours conservation spatial solutions would protect between 10.41% and 15.88%, on average, of suitable areas for the starfish species. Our results indicated priority sites for conservation less affected by anthropic pressures (~2%) when data on human impacts on oceans were incorporated into the spatial prioritization process. We identified a network of priority marine sites for conservation that minimized human influence and considered the effects of climate change on species distribution. We used threatened starfish species as a case study for illustrating our approach; however, such an approach could be applied to any taxonomic group, which supports the development of more effective conservation actions that represent biodiversity under such threats. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Conservation planning; Ecological niche modeling; Human impact; Marine protected areas; Zonation","Brazil; Asteroidea; Gabaza; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecology; Environmental protection; Forestry; Geographical distribution; Population distribution; Conservation planning; Ecological niche modeling; Human impact; Marine protected area; Zonation; anthropogenic effect; climate change; conservation planning; conservation status; ecological modeling; geographical distribution; model; niche; prioritization; range expansion; spatial planning; zonation; Climate change","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047437370"

Various diversity indices, constancy method and cluster analysis were used to analyse species occurrence. The ecological indices showed a possible positive association between species abundance and environmental heterogeneity of the studied areas.

The optimal design of these conservation networks is most frequently based on the modeled habitat suitability or probability of occurrence of species, despite evidence that model predictions may not be highly correlated with species density. We hypothesized that conservation networks designed using species density distributions more efficiently conserve populations of all species considered than networks designed using probability of occurrence models. To test this hypothesis, we used the Zonation conservation prioritization algorithm to evaluate conservation network designs based on probability of occurrence versus density models for 26 land bird species in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. We assessed the efficacy of each conservation network based on predicted species densities and predicted species diversity. High-density model Zonation rankings protected more individuals per species when networks protected the highest priority 10-40% of the landscape. Compared with density-based models, the occurrence-based models protected more individuals in the lowest 50% priority areas of the landscape. The 2 approaches conserved species diversity in similar ways: predicted diversity was higher in higher priority locations in both conservation networks. We conclude that both density and probability of occurrence models can be useful for setting conservation priorities but that density-based models are best suited for identifying the highest priority areas. Developing methods to aggregate species count data from unrelated monitoring efforts and making these data widely available through ecoinformatics portals such as the Avian Knowledge Network will enable species count data to be more widely incorporated into systematic conservation planning efforts. © 2015, Society for Conservation Biology.","Conservation prioritization; Species distribution models; Species diversity; Systematic conservation planning; Zonation","Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; California; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Oregon; Population Density; Probability; Washington; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northwest); United States; Aves; algorithm; bird; conservation planning; numerical model; population density; prioritization; probability; species diversity; zonation; animal; biodiversity; biological model; bird; California; ecosystem; environmental protection; Oregon; physiology; population density; probability; procedures; Washington","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937073339"

Data points where the species were present were collected and linked to bioclimatic variables derived from monthly temperature and rainfall figures from the Africlim database and to edaphic (soil) variables. In term of environmental determinism, the most favourable areas were predicted by bioclimatic variables such as mean diurnal temperature range (Bio2), mean annual rainfall (Bio12), potential evapotranspiration (PET) and a biophysical ground variable. The most favourable protected areas for the seven tree species extended northwards from the Ketou listed forest (7°43'N) in the Guinean zone, from the Agoua listed forest (8°30'N) in the Sudano- Guinean zone and from the Pendjari National Park area (10°35'N) in the Sudanian zone.

Location: The Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil. Methods: We used ecological niche modelling to estimate geographical distributions for 2,255 species under current and future climate scenarios, which we analysed in relation to spatially explicit land use projections, maps of forest remnants derived from remote sensing and socio-economic variables for each municipality within the Atlantic Forest region. We identified spatial priorities that complement the current network of protected areas under three different prioritization scenarios: (1) conservation of existing forest remnants only; (2) conservation of remnants followed by restoration of degraded habitat; and (3) unconstrained actions, in which management location is not defined a priori. We compared our results under different levels of land protection, with targets of 10%, 17% and 20% of the Atlantic Forest extent. Results: Current forest remnants cover only 12% of the Atlantic Forest, so targets of 17% and 20% were achieved only through active restoration. Targets of 17% and 20% captured most species and represented on average 26%–34% of species’ distributions. The spatial pattern of degraded habitats negatively affected representation of biodiversity and implied higher costs and reduced efficiency of planning. We did not observe major differences between conservation prioritizations based on contrasting climate change scenarios. Main conclusions: Protection of forest remnants alone will not suffice to safeguard woody plant species under climate and land use changes; therefore, restoration actions are urgently needed in the Atlantic Forest. With integrated management actions and multicriterion nationwide planning, reaching the 17% of land protection of Aichi biodiversity targets will constitute an important step towards protecting Atlantic Forest biodiversity. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Aichi targets; climate change; ecological restoration; land use change; MaxEnt; spatial conservation prioritization; species distribution modelling; Zonation","Aichi; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Chubu; Honshu; Japan; biodiversity; conservation status; land use change; prioritization; remote sensing; restoration ecology; socioeconomic status; woody plant; zonation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021052731"

Yet, as global change could reduce the future effectiveness of existing PAs in covering high species richness, updating the boundaries of existing PAs or creating new ones might become necessary to uphold conservation goals. Modelling tools are increasingly used by policymakers to support the spatial prioritization of biodiversity conservation, enabling the inclusion of scenarios of environmental changes to achieve specific targets. Here, using the Western Swiss Alps as a case study, we show how integrating species richness derived from species distribution model predictions for four taxonomic groups under present and future climate and land-use conditions into two conservation prioritization schemes can help optimize extant and future PAs. The first scheme, the “Priority Scores Method” identified priority areas for the expansion of the existing PA network. The second scheme, using the zonation software, allowed identifying priority conservation areas while incorporating global change scenarios and political costs. We found that existing mountain PAs are currently not situated in the most environmentally nor politically suitable locations when maximizing alpha diversity for the studied taxonomic groups and that current PAs could become even less optimum under the future climate and land-use change scenarios. This analysis has focused on general areas of high species richness or species of conservation concern and did not account for special habitats or functional groups that could have been used to create the existing network. We conclude that such an integrated framework could support more effective conservation planning and could be similarly applied to other landscapes or other biodiversity conservation indices. © 2019 The Authors","Conservation prioritization; Decision support tools; Land costs; Species distribution models; Switzerland; Zonation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062841504"

In this study, we selected priority areas for conservation in a seasonally dry tropical forest in Brazil and analyzed changes in the protection of ecosystem services and the conservation of plant biodiversity upon excluding areas with high opportunity costs (e.g., where income would be lost if natural areas were protected) and high population density. We identified two types of protected areas: sustainable use (SU) and strict protection (SP). Plant biodiversity (181 species) and supporting services (water balance, net primary productivity, and soil fertility) were used to determine the optimal locations of both types of protected areas. Provisioning services (water supply, fodder, and genetic resources) were used to determine SU priority areas, while regulating services (water purification, carbon storage, and erosion prevention) were used to determine SP areas. The selection of lowly populated or costly areas was associated with a small decrease in the representation of biodiversity (4% loss in SP and 6% loss in SU) and a large decrease in the representation of supporting (36% loss in SP and 31% loss in SU), regulating (41% loss in SP), and provisioning services (7% loss in SU). Our results reveal that selecting priority areas with low population density and low opportunity costs would decrease the overall representation of ecosystem services in protected areas but would still improve the cost efficiency of biodiversity conservation efforts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Caatinga; Conservation policy; Natural capital; Opportunity costs; Vulnerability; Zonation","Brazil; biodiversity; biozonation; conservation planning; cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; ecosystem service; human activity; nature conservation; protected area; resource use; strategic approach; tropical forest; vulnerability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033589616"

It is assumed that this will assure the long-term survival of Europe's most valuable and threatened species and habitats. The new member states implemented the Natura 2000 Directives in their own legislation as a part of the EU-integration process. Here we present the practical difficulties of implementing these directives in the Czech Republic as a warning of the problems likely to be encountered in post-communist countries. Our results are mainly based on a case study of the Šumava National Park. We analyze, why Natura 2000 may not work here and look for possible solutions, which would require changes in Natura 2000 policies and their implementation in national policies. We show five examples of activities, which were performed or are still planned despite the fact that Natura 2000 evaluations have clearly shown that they have or would have had significant negative effects on Natura 2000 habitats and species. These include canoeing in pearl mussels core zones, logging of spruce stands, park zonation and management, and ski lift and tourist trails in capercaillie core zones. We deduce that the unstable political conditions together with the weak position of the state representatives in the Czech Republic result in a situation in which the last remnants of justice together with newly implemented EU directives easily disappear. We then show that the problems encountered in implementing Natura 2000 directives in the Czech Republic are likely to affect their successful implementation in most other post-communist countries. EU is supporting these countries financially, but this support should be much more conditional on full implementation of EU laws. Environmental subsidies should be conditional on fulfilment of the country's obligations to EU nature protection. Proper use of EU money should be directly controlled by central EU authorities, not left entirely to the recipients, the member states. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Biodiversity; Natura 2000; Post-communist countries; Šumava national park","Czech Republic; Sumava National Park; Aves; Picea; biodiversity; bird; endangered species; European Union; habitat management; long-term change; national planning; protected area; survival","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84927138462"

Existing ecological restoration measures are singular and lack pertinence and systematicness. Thus, a gap between the expectations and real ecological restoration effects exists. This study was based on Haizhouwan National Marine Park, a national MPA of China. After investigating and evaluating the ecological environment in the Haizhouwan protected area (HPA), ecosystem health assessments to three ecological subsystems (i.e., island terrestrial, intertidal, and neritic ecosystems) and vulnerability assessments to the main protected objects (i.e., landforms) were conducted. This study was integrated with the functional zonation of the HPA, which enabled it to conduct an analytic hierarchy process for the assessment results to obtain ecological restoration zoning. According to the zoning, the HPA can be divided into 12 ecological restoration zones, namely, 2 key restoration zones, 3 general restoration zones, 2 taking-into-account restoration zones, and 5 maintaining-the-status zones. This paper also provides pertinent ecological restoration measures and recommendations to the environmental, ecological, and protected object problems existing in different zones. The study results can provide empirical references for the development of ecological restoration plans and measures for the HPA. The zoning method can also be applied to the ecological protection and restoration research of other MPAs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","","China; China; Haizhouwan National Marine Park; Jiangsu; Conservation; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Zoning; Conservation; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Restoration; Zoning; Ecological environments; Ecological functions; Ecological protection; Ecological restoration; Ecosystem health; Marine protected area; Protected object; Vulnerability assessments; ecosystem health; environmental protection; environmental restoration; hierarchical system; marine park; restoration ecology; vulnerability; Restoration; Ecology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904464414"

The distribution of Fraxinus mandshurica in northeast China was assessed, and our goal was to develop model-based strategies for the assessment of PPAs in consideration of climate change. To achieve this goal, we mapped the current and future suitable habitat distributions of F. mandshurica and planned PPAs based on 4 field surveys in northeast China. The models used in this study included a species distribution model (Maxent), systematic conservation planning model (Zonation), and geographic information system (ArcGIS 10.0). To promote sustainable development, the current and future suitable habitats of F. mandshurica must be integrated into the assessment of PPAs; however, the conservation areas of F. mandshurica in existing nature reserves cannot realize the conservation criterion of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC). In the eastern and northeastern regions of northeast China, the suitable habitats are predicted to migrate slightly northwards in the future.

Location: South America. Methods: We identified all those amphibians, mammals and birds whose distributions were at least 70% within the Gran Chaco. Then, we refined and corrected species’ distributional ranges, first, using records from collections and expert knowledge, and second, by incorporating environmental and topographic data using a technique for range polygon refinement. Lastly, we used Zonation, a spatial conservation prioritization software, to evaluate representativeness of the current protected areas (PAs) network of the region and to define forest remnants to strategically expand PAs while maximizing the representativeness of the selected groups and considering human activities. Results: Current PAs cover 9% of the region and represent 9.1% of the total distribution of endemic species. Considering our prioritization, increasing the coverage to 17% to match the Aichi targets would substantially increase the representativeness of the PA network, covering on average more than 30% of the ranges of all endemic species and 77% of the distributions of threatened and DD endemic species. Main conclusions: Our results highlight that the need for well-informed decisions in the Gran Chaco is imperative. While the current PA network in the region ensures a very poor representation of endemic terrestrial vertebrates, opportunities to efficiently expand the PAs network are really high. This emphasizes the potential of complementarity-based systematic conservation planning tools as an essential support for conservation decisions. Given the great information gaps regarding biodiversity and human activities in the region, similar studies with updated data would improve conservation planning in the Gran Chaco in the future. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Aichi targets; conservation policy; habitat loss; protected areas; systematic conservation planning; vertebrates","Aichi; Chubu; Gran Chaco; Honshu; Japan; Amphibia; Aves; Mammalia; Vertebrata; amphibian; biodiversity; bird; conservation planning; conservation status; decision making; ecoregion; endangered species; endemic species; habitat loss; human activity; mammal; prioritization; protected area; software; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84993865300"

The southern Espinhaço mountains in Brazil are particularly important because they currently harbor 255 threatened plant species at risk of extinction owing to overspread farming, mining and uncontrolled fire in the region. Using the best available data on the distribution of these threatened species, distribution of farming and mining activities, and up-to-date data on fire frequency, here we developed a systematic conservation plan for all these species and pinpointed priority regions for taking different conservation actions. We found that it is possible to protect, on average, more than 25% of the threatened species ranges, avoiding sites with extensive use for farming and mining and favoring areas with intensive fire frequency while constraining the management to a relatively small area of only 17% of the region. The analysis accounts for what is already protected within protected areas in the region and is, therefore, complementary to the work already held by the actors and environmental organizations of the region. We offer maps of priority areas with their respective level of protection and suggest conservation actions at different levels of engagement to be implemented in the priority areas. These priority areas are part of a national species recovery plan for the region in Brazil and will likely support stakeholders and decision makers in its application in the forthcoming years. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Campos rupestres; Cerrado; Endangered species; Rupestrian grasslands; Systematic conservation planning; Zonation","Brazil; Serra do Espinhaco; biozonation; cerrado; conservation planning; ecological zonation; endangered species; extinction; flora; grassland; human activity; mountain region; protected area; recovery plan","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016402215"

Given the conflicting interests arising from multiple uses of seascapes and finite funds for conservation, developing cost-effective strategies for marine biodiversity conservation is crucial to support decision making. Here, we identified sites in Brazilian waters that would maximize species representation and avoid potential conflicts with relevant economic activities. We compared conservation benefits provided by three conservation-planning scenarios that incorporated the distribution of 750 marine vertebrate species, while considering established marine protected areas (MPAs) and blocks concessioned for the oil and gas industry. The results showed that a MPA network encompassing 10% of the study area with high conservation priority would cover between 85.8 and 86.5% of species distributions, on average. We found that incorporating existing MPAs and areas concessioned for oil and gas exploitation in the prioritization process caused only a small loss in representation of near-threatened and threatened species. Our results highlight, therefore, that it is possible to reconcile current offshore oil and gas production with the expansion of the national MPA network, without significant losses in species' representation.

The utility of these procedures is limited because distributions of species are typically available only as coarse atlases or range maps, whereas conservation planners need to prioritize relatively small sites. If such coarse-resolution information can be used to identify small sites that efficiently represent species (i.e., downscaled), then such data can be useful for conservation planning. We develop and test a new type of surrogate for biodiversity, which we call downscaled complementarity. In this approach, complementarity values from large cells are downscaled to small cells, using statistical methods or simple map overlays. We illustrate our approach for birds in Spain by building models at coarse scale (50 × 50 km atlas of European birds, and global range maps of birds interpreted at the same 50 × 50 km grid size), using this model to predict complementary value for 10 × 10 km cells in Spain, and testing how well-prioritized cells represented bird distributions in an independent bird atlas of those 10 × 10 km cells. Downscaled complementarity was about 63–77% as effective as having full knowledge of the 10-km atlas data in its ability to improve on random selection of sites. Downscaled complementarity has relatively low data acquisition cost and meets representation goals well compared with other surrogates currently in use. Our study justifies additional tests to determine whether downscaled complementarity is an effective surrogate for other regions and taxa, and at spatial resolution finer than 10 × 10 km cells. Until such tests have been completed, we caution against assuming that any surrogate can reliably prioritize sites for species representation. © 2016 The Authors.

Recently, this area has experienced pressure from visitors and significant infrastructural development. When the previous Management Plan expired in 2017, the PLNP initiated and adopted a new Management Plan. This involved the zonation of management in order to better conserve and use this protected area. Management zonation was based on spatial and other data on the distributions of the species and habitats (Natura 2000 and others); cultural values and geo-localities; visitor experiences; existing and planned infrastructure and settlements. Visitor classes and zones were determined using the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS) methodology. The new management zonation resulted in an increase of 13.9% in the area of the Park included in the Strict Conservation Zone, while succession and habitat degradation resulted in a decrease in the area of the Park in the Active Management Zone, especially in terms of grassland.

However, it is not clear how the individual and combined effects of climate change and land-use change will affect their conservation in the future. We used a spatial conservation prioritization framework to determine future shifts in the priority areas for the conservation of 169 bat species under projected climate and land-use change scenarios across Africa. Specifically, we modelled species distribution models under four different climate change scenarios at the 2050 horizon. We used land-use change scenarios within the spatial conservation prioritization framework to assess habitat quality in areas where bats may shift their distributions. Overall, bats' representation within already existing protected areas in Africa was low (∼5% of their suitable habitat in protected areas which cover ∼7% of Africa). Accounting for future land-use change resulted in the largest shift in spatial priority areas for conservation actions, and species representation within priority areas for conservation actions decreased by ∼9%. A large proportion of spatial conservation priorities will shift from forested areas with little disturbance under present conditions to agricultural areas in the future. Planning land use to reduce impacts on bats in priority areas outside protected areas where bats will be shifting their ranges in the future is crucial to enhance their conservation and maintain the important ecosystem services they provide to humans. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The trend is typical for a new Russian territory – the Crimean Peninsula. The article presents results of analysis of current structure of natural resource use in PAs of the Crimean Peninsula that is represented by 208 objects. The current PAs system of Crimea along with its structure by categories, number of objects and their areas is demonstrated. The maximum PAs area is accounted for wildlife refuges (zakazniks) and nature reserves – the objects of strict protection (75%). The data also provided on the dynamics of PAs system formation from 2000 to 2014. It was indicated the increase in number of protected areas by 46%, and their area by 57%. Proportion for the areas covered by PAs in each administrative unit of the Crimean Peninsula has been calculated. It was found that the proportion of protected areas is higher in the urban districts. Bakhchisarai district with PAs ratio above 10% stands out from the other peninsula districts. In seven districts protected areas has not been established yet. A wide range of land use types is indicated for wildlife refuges and natural monuments. Types of natural resource use are identified, which are represented in protected areas of the Crimean Peninsula (a case of Baidarskii Reserve), and their spatial structure is demonstrated. The main types of nature resource use in Baidarskii Reserve are recreational, forestry, agricultural and residential. At the same time, special attention has been paid to the geoecological problems that have arisen because of different types of nature resource use. Agriculture caused transformation of vegetation, soils, and pasture digression. Recreational use of natural resources contributed to changing the composition and structure of plant communities, along with transforming density of upper soil layers. Recreational load is localized mainly along touristic trails.","Baidarskii Reserve; Ecological network; Functional zoning; Natural resource use; Natural resource use structure; Recreation; Recreational load; Reserve; Specially protected areas (PAs); The Crimean Peninsula","Crimea; Crimean Mountains; Russian Federation; Ukraine; agricultural practice; community structure; ecological zonation; economic activity; forestry; land use; natural resource; nature reserve; plant community; protected area; recreational activity; refuge; resource use; wildlife management; zoning policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040829869"

However, conservation planning associated with the large-scale network in China involves important information loopholes about the land cover and landscape connectivity. In this paper, we made an integrative analysis for the identification of conservation priority areas and least-cost ecological corridors (ECs) in order to promote a more representative, connected and efficient ecological PA network for this country. First, we used Zonation, a spatial prioritization software, to achieve a hierarchical mask and selected the top priority conservation areas. Second, we identified optimal linkages between two patches as corridors based on least-cost path algorithm. Finally, we proposed a new framework of China's PA network composed of conservation priority and ECs in consideration of high connectivity between areas. We observed that priority areas identified here cover 12.9% of the region, distributed mainly in mountainous and plateau areas, and only reflect a spatial mismatch of 19% with the current China's nature reserves locations. From the perspective of conservation, our result provide the need to consider new PA categories, specially located in the south (e.g., the middle-lower Yangtze River area, Nanling and Min-Zhe-Gan Mountains) and north regions (e.g., Changbai Mountains), in order to construct an optimal and connected national network in China. This information allows us better opportunities to identify the relative high-quality patches and draft the best conservation plan for the China's biodiversity in the long-term run. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","China; Ecological corridors; Landscape connectivity; Priority areas; Protected area network","Algorithms; Biodiversity; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Ecosystem; Human Activities; Humans; Spatial Analysis; Urbanization; China; Biodiversity; Conservation; Cost benefit analysis; Environmental protection; China; Ecological corridors; Landscape connectivities; Priority areas; Protected areas; biodiversity; conservation planning; habitat corridor; human activity; land cover; landscape; nature conservation; protected area; Article; biodiversity; China; environmental planning; environmental protection; habitat quality; human activities; land use; landscape; mathematical analysis; priority journal; spatial analysis; urbanization; zonation; algorithm; biodiversity; ecology; ecosystem; human; Ecology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040307647"

Terceira has 3011 ha of peatland, of which 44 % is forested. Bogs and fens account for 14 % and 3 % of this area, respectively, while 39 % has been classified as degraded peatland. Overall, 46 % of the peatland is still in natural condition and 80 % of this is concentrated in two ‘wild’ areas known as Santa Barbara and Pico Alto, which are separated by an intervening expanse of land with mainly disturbed mires. Most of the peatland lies within a Natural Park (82 %) and a Special Conservation Area (SCA; 67 %). The wildest peatland (70 %) is in Ramsar and public forestry areas. A management zonation to define priority areas for protection and restoration is proposed. This includes three reserve areas and six buffer areas, in which controlled management to inhibit potential direct impacts on the wildest peatland should be implemented. This model includes a corridor between the two major reserves to promote connectivity. Nowadays the local extent of peatland is less than the potential area. Moreover, an assessment of peatland condition indicates a need for development of strategies to conserve wild peatland and implement restoration to improve the naturalness of disturbed peatland, as well as the ecological connectivity between the two major mire-rich natural protected areas on the island. © 2019 International Mire Conservation Group and International Peatland Society,.","Cartography; Classification; Natural park; Peatland management zonation model; Public areas; Ramsar; Special Conservation Area (SCA)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093887234"

There are very limited published reports on prevalence and risk of parasites in wild populations of red panda, especially localized reports. This study attempts to provide an in- depth insight of the status of endoparasites in red pandas, which is critical for strengthening conservation efforts. A total of 272 fecal samples were collected through systematic sampling across the red panda distribution range in Nepal and coprological examination was completed using standard techniques. It was followed by an estimation of prevalence and mean intensity of parasites, as well as statistical analysis, which was carried out using R statistical software. Parasite prevalence was documented in 90.80% (n=247) out of 272 samples examined which includes seven different species along with three genera of parasites belonging to Protozoans (3 species), Cestodes (1 genus, 1 species) and Nematodes (2 genera, 3 species). Nematodes predominated in all infected samples (87.62%). Prevalence of Ancyclostoma duodenale (n=227, 70.06%), having a mean intensity of 3.45 ± 2.88 individuals per sample, was observed, followed by Ascaris lumbricoides (n=19, 5.86%) and Entamoeba histolytica (n=24, 7.41%). Eight variables for assessing the determinants of infestation were tested: protected areas; non-protected areas; aspect; elevation; slope; and distance to water sources, herding stations, and settlements. Only the settlement displayed significant association (β=-1534e-04, t=-2.192, p=0.0293) though each parasite species displayed dissimilar association with different variables. This study indicates the urgent need of improving existing herding practice through habitat zonation, rotational grazing, medication of livestock, and prohibition of open defecation within and around red panda habitat. © 2017 Bista et al.","Endoparasites; Gastrointestinal parasites; Prevalence; Red panda; Threat","malachite green; Ancylostoma duodenale; Article; Ascaris lumbricoides; cestode; Cyclospora cayetanensis; Diphyllobothrium; Entamoeba histolytica; environmental parameters; feces analysis; intestine parasite; nematode; Nepal; nonhuman; parasite prevalence; parasitosis; protozoon; red panda; Sarcocystis; smear; species distribution; Strongyloides; water supply","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028951453"

Depth has been identified as the main factor structuring the polychaete communities in both seas, countering the prevalent notion of extended eurybathy of the Southern Ocean benthos. From an evolutionary perspective, this strong dissimilarity between shelf and slope fauna could be interpreted as evidence for survival in shelf refugias, rather than migration into deeper waters during glacial maxima. The previously unsampled Amundsen Sea is shown to be diverse, harbouring a high level of taxonomic novelty, with many species new to science. The polychaete community of the inner shelf in the Amundsen Sea (Pine Island Bay) has also been shown to be of deep-sea character, likely due to intrusion of the Circumpolar Deep Water onto the shelf.

The study was carried out in two protected areas, located in central Italy, subjected to different shoreline trends in recent years. 75 plots were identified along eleven randomly positioned cross-shore transects, starting from the beach continuing up to the plant communities of the backdunes. In each plot floristic and environmental data - such as distance to the coastline, plot altitude, inclination, shoreline trend, mean grain-size, sorting, pH, conductivity and organic matter concentration - were collected. The analyses revealed significant changes of vegetational cover, dune morphology and geopedological features along the coast-to-inland gradient. Relationships between vegetation composition and environmental factors were investigated through Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Four factors - distance to the coastline, mean grain-size, shoreline trend and organic matter - were found to be closely correlated with the floristic composition of plant communities. Finally, soil properties were highlighted as the most determinant factors of community zonation in these Mediterranean coastal dune ecosystems.

However, many reserves are characterized by several problems mainly related to inadequate zonings that often do not protect high biodiversity and propagule supply areas precluding, at the same time, economic important zones for local interests. The Gulf of Naples is here employed as a study area to assess the effects of inclusion of different conservation features and costs in reserve design process. In particular eight scenarios are developed using graph theory to identify propagule source patches and fishing and exploitation activities as costs-in-use for local population. Scenarios elaborated by MARXAN, software commonly used for marine conservation planning, are compared using multivariate analyses (MDS, PERMANOVA and PERMDISP) in order to assess input data having greatest effects on protected areas selection. MARXAN is heuristic software able to give a number of different correct results, all of them near to the best solution. Its outputs show that the most important areas to be protected, in order to ensure long-term habitat life and adequate propagule supply, are mainly located around the Gulf islands. In addition through statistical analyses it allowed us to prove that different choices on conservation features lead to statistically different scenarios. The presence of propagule supply patches forces MARXAN to select almost the same areas to protect decreasingly different MARXAN results and, thus, choices for reserves area selection. The multivariate analyses applied here to marine spatial planning proved to be very helpful allowing to identify i) how different scenario input data affect MARXAN and ii) what features have to be taken into account in study areas characterized by peculiar biological and economic interests. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Connectivity analysis; Graph theory; Marine conservation planning; MARXAN; Multivariate analyses","Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Costs and Cost Analysis; Ecosystem; Multivariate Analysis; Gulf of Naples; Mediterranean Sea; Tyrrhenian Sea; biodiversity; coastal zone management; connectivity; conservation management; conservation planning; environmental assessment; environmental impact assessment; exploitation; graphical method; marine ecosystem; marine park; multivariate analysis; patch dynamics; propagule; software; spatial planning; Article; clinical assessment; coastal waters; community ecology; conservation biology; controlled study; cost; fishing; marine biology; marine environment; multivariate analysis; nonhuman; population; propagule; software; species habitat; zonation; biodiversity; economics; ecosystem; environmental protection; multivariate analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042763677"

Despite the extent of Italian forests in terms of altitude and latitude, there has been only one previous quantitative study of their molluscan faunas. This paper describes the molluscan communities of six forest habitats in northern Italy along an altitudinal transect. Species richness had its highest values at low elevations, especially in maritime woodland and in riverine poplar woodland. Species abundance decreased from lowland to montane habitats, possibly as a consequence of a transition from eutrophic to oligotrophic habitats and from calcareous to acidic soils. Compared with the central and northern European forests, the Italian forests were poorer as far as species richness is concerned, but showed greater diversity among locations as the Jaccard presence/absence similarity index among habitats is equal or lower than 0.5. Considering abundances, all molluscan communities were significantly different in pairwise comparisons, with the single exception of the montane mixed-deciduous and beech forests. The low faunal similarity among sites and the high percentage of species found in only one habitat support the need for a network of diverse protected areas to preserve land-mollusc biodiversity. © 2013 © The Author 2014.

Rapid and continuous urban expansion, however, may exert negative effects on the performance of practical zoning designs. Various methods have been developed for protected area zoning, but most of them failed to consider the conflicts between urban development (for the benefit of land developers) and ecological protection (local government). Some real-world zoning schemes even have to be modified occasionally after the lengthy negotiations between the government and land developers. Therefore, our study has presented a game theory-based method to deal with this problem. Future urban expansion in the study area will be predicted by a logistic regression cellular automaton, while eco-protected areas will be delimitated using multi-objective optimization algorithm. Then, two types of conflicts between them can be resolved based on game theory, a theory of decision-making. We established a two-person dynamic game for each conflict zone. The ecological compensation mechanism was taken into account by simulating the negotiation processes between the government and land developers. A final zoning scheme can be obtained when the two sides reach agreements. The proposed method is applied to the eco-protected area zoning in Guangzhou, a fast-growing city in China. The experiments indicate that the conflicts between eco-protection and urban development will inevitably arise when using only traditional zoning methods. Based on game theory, our method can effectively resolve those conflicts, and can provide a relatively reasonable zoning scheme. This method is expected to support policy-making in environmental management and urban planning. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cellular automata; Ecological protection; Game theory; Urban expansion; Zoning","Algorithms; China; City Planning; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Game Theory; Humans; Local Government; Negotiating; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; algorithm; cellular automaton; conflict management; conservation management; decision making; design; environmental management; game theory; local government; optimization; protected area; urban development; zonation; case report; China; city planning; compensation; consensus development; decision making; environmental management; game; government; human; logistic regression analysis; theoretical model; algorithm; city planning; ecosystem; environmental protection; interpersonal communication; procedures","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84956661673"

Unfortunately, these areas are severely threatened due to direct and indirect anthropogenic effects. In this context, with the aim to improve the effectiveness of threatened fish protection, the Life project BARBIE (LIFE13 NAT/IT/001129) started in 2014 and focused on three congeneric species of the genus Barbus: two of “priority interest” sensu Habitats Directive [Barbus caninus (Bonaparte, 1839), and B. plebejus (Bonaparte, 1839)], and one alien [Barbus barbus (Linnaeus, 1758)]. Our main objective was to assess the contribution of a complex of protected areas included in the Natura 2000 network - located in the provinces of Parma, Piacenza and Reggio Emilia (Norther Italy) - to support the presence of the three barbel species in analysis. Additionally, we explored the role of a set of environmental variables (i.e., physical, chemical, biological, and land-use descriptors) to drive the current conditions of the study sites and the responses of Barbus species. As a general rule, the present study confirmed a clear decline of the local native barbel populations, and confirmed the existence of a zonation pattern of the barbel taxa. Hence, we observed a strong altitude segregation between native vs. alien species, with the exotic B. barbus currently limited to plain and only sporadically present in the Apennine areas as genetic introgression. These evidences mirrored the altitudinal gradients of anthropogenic disturbance. The main causes were the progressive disappearance of well-structured riparian stripes, and the intense land use change, ranging from semi-natural patches (mountain and hill sectors) to land clearing for intensive agriculture (lowland sectors). This highlights the need to take into account the spatial dynamics of alien invasive species in programming recovery actions that could have unexpected impacts to the native fish populations, for example the reduction of the hydraulic fragmentation along rivers. © 2017, Page Press Publications.

The 50 species that were most threatened, geographically restricted, and evolutionarily distinct faced a greater extinction risk than globally nonthreatened and wide-ranging species and species with several close relatives. Small, medium-sized, and data-deficient species faced extinction from inadequate protection in PAs relative to wide-ranging charismatic species. There was a mismatch between current PA distribution and priority areas for conservation of the 50 most endangered species. To protect these species, the skewed regional PA distribution would require expansion. Where possible, new PAs and transboundary reserves in the 35 priority areas we identified should be established. There are adequate remaining natural areas in which to expand current Eastern Himalayan PAs.

Various international and regional agreements require that nations designate sufficient marine areas under protection. Assessing the functionality and coherence of MPA networks is challenging, unless extensive data on species and habitats is available. We evaluated the efficiency of the Finnish MPA network by utilizing a unique dataset of ~140,000 samples, recently collected by the Finnish Inventory Programme for the Underwater Marine Environment, VELMU. Using the quantitative conservation planning and the spatial prioritization method Zonation, we identified sites of high biodiversity and developed a balanced ranking of marine conservation values. Only 27% of the ecologically most valuable features were covered by the current MPA network. Based on the analyses, a set of expansion sites were identified that efficiently complement the ecological and geographical gaps in the current MPA network. Increasing protected sea area by just one percent point, would double the mean conservation cover, and specifically increase the protection levels of habitat types based on IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, key species, threatened species and fish reproduction areas. We also discovered that a large part of ecologically valuable species, such as many brown and red algae, blue mussels and eelgrass, exist in the underwater parts of rocky islands and sandy shores. These areas do not belong to the present (Finnish) interpretation of the habitats (e.g., reefs and underwater sandbanks) listed in the EU Habitats Directive. Neglecting these environments may lead to lack of protection of functionally important biodiversity. We emphasize that, in addition to establishing MPAs, also ecosystem-based marine spatial planning is needed to safeguard the integrity of marine biodiversity in the northern Baltic Sea. The spatial prioritization maps produced in this study are essentially environmental value maps which can also be used in impact avoidance, such as siting of wind energy and aquaculture, or in avoiding overfishing in the most valuable fish areas. Our approach and analytical procedure can be replicated in the Baltic Sea or elsewhere provided that sufficient data exist. © 2018 Virtanen, Viitasalo, Lappalainen and Moilanen.","Baltic Sea; Boosted regression trees; Conservation planning; Marine spatial planning; Spatial conservation prioritization; Species distribution modeling; Zonation software","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056108981"

Argentinian-protected areas have been established mainly to protect vertebrates and plants in terrestrial ecosystems. In order to create a comprehensive biodiverse conservation plan, it is crucial to integrate both aquatic and terrestrial systems and to include macroinvertebrates. Here, we address this topic by proposing priority areas of conservation including invertebrates, aquatic ecosystems, and their connectivity and land uses. Location: Northwest of Argentina. We modeled the ecological niches of different taxa of macroinvertebrates such as Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera, Megaloptera, Lepidoptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Acari, and Mollusca. Based on these models, we analyzed the contribution of currently established protected areas in the conservation of the aquatic biodiversity and we propose a spatial prioritization taking into account possible conflict regarding different land uses. Our analysis units were the real watersheds, to which were added longitudinal connectivity up and down the rivers. A total of 132 species were modeled in the priority area analyses. The analysis 1 showed that only an insignificant percentage of the macroinvertebrates distribution is within the protected areas in the North West of Argentina. The analyses 2 and 3 recovered similar values of protection for the macroinvertebrate species. The upper part of Bermejo, Salí-Dulce, San Francisco, and the Upper part of Juramento basins were identified as priority areas of conservation. The aquatic ecosystems need special protection and 10% or even as much as 17% of land conservation is insufficient for species of macroinvertebrates. In turn the protected areas need to combine the aquatic and terrestrial systems and need to include macroinvertebrates as a key group to sustain the biodiversity. In many cases, the land uses are in conflict with the conservation of biodiversity; however, it is possible to apply the connectivity of the watersheds and create multiple-use modules. © 2017 The Authors.

In South East Asia, coastal communities are much more likely to be dependent on marine resources for livelihoods, with limited opportunities for livelihood diversification, compared with coastal communities in more developed countries. Recognising the overwhelming global targets for the protection of marine habitats, there needs to be more consideration for the way that people fit in to the way that conservation programmes are designed and implemented. Bearing in mind the factors that are widely considered to make marine protected areas successful, the governance strategies involved, and the resources needed to implement the number of protected areas required, the situation is extremely complex. Theory suggests that if we implement a large number of protected areas, then it is reasonable to assume that some of them will be successful. However, this is where it is essential to remember the people impacted by protected areas. This chapter seeks to identify a number of the issues facing the effective implementation of conservation strategies, in an effort to identify a path towards effective marine resource management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We had three key findings. First, dry forest is the least protected biome in Mesoamerica (4.5% protected), indicating that further action to safeguard this biome is warranted. Secondly, the poor overlap between protected areas and high-value forest conservation areas found herein may provide evidence that the establishment of protected areas may not be fully accounting for tree priority rank map. Third, high percentages of forest cover and high-value forest conservation areas still need to be represented by the protected areas network.

The key marine areas were located on the southern Patagonian Shelf, overlapping extensively with areas of high fishing activity, and did not change seasonally, while seasonal areas were located off south and southeast Brazil and overlapped with areas of high plastic pollution and ocean acidification. Non-seasonal key areas were located off northeast Brazil on an area of high biodiversity, and with relatively low human impacts. We found support for the use of seasonal areas depending on the seabird assemblage used, because there was a loss in conservation value for the seasonal compared to the non-seasonal approach when using ‘cost’ layers. Our approach, accounting for seasonal changes in seabird assemblages and their risk of extinction, identified additional candidate areas for incorporation in the network of pelagic MPAs. © 2017 The Zoological Society of London","Brazil; conservation value; marine protected areas; seabird tracking; species distribution model; species distribution modelling; Zonation","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Southwest); Patagonian Shelf; conservation management; extinction risk; marine park; modeling; pelagic environment; risk assessment; seabird; species conservation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85012986120"

However, EN ability to conserve biodiversity is potentially influenced by past and present disturbances, and spatial configuration of habitat patches. Here, we investigated how plant assemblages of a subtropical EN in a timber production landscape in South Africa respond to disturbance history (i.e. natural vs. recovering after removal of Pinus spp.), mowing in firebreaks (i.e. 30 m wide grassy strips intended to stop spread of fires in plantations), and three design parameters: corridor width, distance to protected area boundary, and context i.e. proportion eucalypt compartments within 500 m radius. Reference sites were in the adjacent iSimangaliso Wetland Park, a protected area (PA). Past disturbances and the current practice of mowing in firebreaks significantly influenced plant species composition, but not plant species richness. Plant dominance was greatest in mowed firebreaks, but similar between natural and recovering grassland. None of the design variables affected plant species richness, or composition. However, dominance was significantly and negatively correlated with corridor width, and positively correlated with context. Hence, sites are ordered in terms of their biodiversity value from greatest to lowest: natural areas > recovering areas > firebreaks. Based on these results, natural grassland in wide, well-connected corridors should have greatest conservation priority. We recommend that past disturbances, and current management practices should be taken into account and integrated into the design of future ENs. Such an approach is necessary for effective biodiversity conservation in production landscapes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Firebreaks; Mown; Plantation forestry; Recovering grassland","iSimangaliso Wetland Park; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa; biodiversity; conservation planning; disturbance; ecological zonation; ecosystem structure; forestry production; grassland; land use change; landscape history; patch use; plantation forestry; protected area; restoration ecology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961678009"

Conservation policies are likely to become obsolete unless they integrate the potential impacts of climate and land-use change on biodiversity. Objectives: We identify conservation priority areas for current and future projected distributions of Iberian bird species. We then investigate the extent to which global change informed priority areas are: (i) covered by existing protected area networks (national protected areas and Natura 2000); (ii) threatened by agricultural or urban land-use changes. Methods: We use outputs of species distributions models fitted with climatic data as inputs in spatial prioritization tools to identify conservation priority areas for 168 bird species. We use projections of land-use change to then discriminate between threatened and non-threatened priority areas. Results: 19% of the priority areas for birds are covered by national protected areas and 23% are covered by Natura 2000 sites. The spatial mismatch between protected area networks and priority areas for birds is projected to increase with climate change. But there are opportunities to improve the protection of birds under climate change, as half of the priority areas are currently neither protected nor in conflict with urban or agricultural land-uses. Conclusions: We identify critical areas for bird conservation both under current and climate change conditions, and propose that they could guide the establishment of new conservation areas across the Iberian Peninsula complementing existing protected areas. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Bioclimatic envelope models; Breeding birds; Conservation planning; Land-use change; Natura 2000; Portugal; Protected areas; Reserve networks; Spain; Zonation software","Aves","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044759609"

This formation represents the first carbonate-dominated and fossil-rich sedimentary unit of the Devonian of the Iberian Chains. Nine sedimentary facies, including terrigenous-clastic, mixed and carbonate facies, which are complexly intercalated at bed scale, have been characterized. Based on their sedimentary features and their lateral relationships using Markov chain analysis, two sedimentary models for the lower and upper part of d2a member have been proposed, which represent deposition in a mixed clastic-carbonate shallow marine depositional system. They include terrigenous-clastic intertidal deposits and predominant skeletal, carbonate-dominated and grain-supported facies in the high-energy shallow subtidal zone, whith a clear zonation of the skeletal components (brachiopods, bryozoans and crinoids, from shallow to relatively deep areas). Phosphate nodules, phosphatized fossils, ferruginous crusts and iron ooids, which are frequently associated with the relatively shallower bioclastic brachiopod facies, were probably linked to mineral continental sources and to remobilization in the shallow water high-energy area. The paleontological analysis shows that some of those organisms lived in protected areas of the subtidal zone, including in particular high-diversity communities of brachiopods, adapted to turbid waters with fine terrigenous suspended sediments. © 2018 Sociedad Geologica de Espana.

Short-range connectivity within habitat networks provides organisms access to spatially distributed resources, reduces local extinctions and increases recolonization of habitat fragments. Long-range connectivity across habitat networks facilitates annual migrations and climate-driven range shifts. We present a method for identifying a multipurpose network of forest patches that promotes both short- and long-range connectivity. Our method uses both graph-theoretic analyses that quantify network connectedness and circuit-based analyses that quantify network traversability as the basis for identifying spatial conservation priorities on the landscape. We illustrate our approach in the agroecosystem, bordered by the Laurentian and Appalachian mountain ranges, that surrounds the metropolis of Montreal, Canada. We established forest conservation priorities for the ovenbird, a Neotropical migrant, sensitive to habitat fragmentation that breeds in our study area. All connectivity analyses were based on the same empirically informed resistance surface for ovenbird, but habitat pixels that facilitated short- and long-range connectivity requirements had low spatial correlation. The trade-off between connectivity requirements in the final ranking of conservation priorities showed a pattern of diminishing returns such that beyond a threshold, additional conservation of long-range connectivity had decreased effectiveness on the conservation of short-range connectivity. Highest conservation priority was assigned to a series of stepping stone forest patches across the study area that promote traversability between the bordering mountain ranges and to a collection of small forest fragments scattered throughout the study area that provide connectivity within the agroecosystem. Landscape connectivity is important for the ecology and genetics of populations threatened by climate change and habitat fragmentation. Our method has been illustrated as a means to conserve two critical dimensions of connectivity for a single species, but it is designed to incorporate a variety of connectivity requirements for many species. Our approach can be tailored to local, regional and continental conservation initiatives to protect essential species movements that will allow biodiversity to persist in a changing climate. © 2016 British Ecological Society."," zonation; Circuitscape; Climate change; Connectivity conservation; Dispersal; Modelling; Protected areas; Spatial conservation planning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958862996"

Recent researches have shown that the actual approaches used in planning PPAs are useful for the conservation of endangered plants. The next required step is to determine how to protect endangered plants effectively in PPAs. Here, we used the case of 84 endangered plants in China to integrate conservation management into the planning of PPAs. First, we identified locations for proposed PPAs based on current and future suitable habitats of species, based on shifts due to climate change, as modelled by Maxent; secondly, we classified the species into different clusters based on the value of protecting them and the factors that threaten them; finally, we determined the best regions for conservation management. We found that species with high material, medicinal, and scientific research values of protection were threatened by over-exploitation and excess reclamation in PPAs. The best candidate PPAs were distributed mainly in southern China—the provinces of Fujiang, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Zhejiang and Guizhou held large potential for the protection of endangered plant species. Given the attention that we paid to conservation management for the planning of PPAs, and the practical value of study, our method will provide an important point of reference for the implementation of policy to protect endangered plants from the effects of climate change, along with information about the values of protecting species and the factors that threaten them. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","China; Climate change; Conservation management; Endangered plants; Maxent; Threatening factors; Value of protection; Zonation","China; Fu River; Fujian; Guangdong; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Guizhou; Hubei; Hunan; Zhejiang; climate change; conservation management; conservation planning; ecological zonation; endangered species; environmental protection; exploitation; human activity; location decision; planning method; plant community; policy implementation; prioritization; protected area; species conservation; valuation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942365130"

The challenge lies in simultaneously satisfying the connectivity needs of multiple species at multiple spatial scales under uncertain climate and land-use change. To evaluate the contribution of remnant habitat fragments to the connectivity of regional habitat networks, we developed a method to integrate uncertainty in climate and land-use change projections with the latest developments in network-connectivity research and spatial, multipurpose conservation prioritization. We used land-use change simulations to explore robustness of species’ habitat networks to alternative development scenarios. We applied our method to 14 vertebrate focal species of periurban Montreal, Canada. Accounting for connectivity in spatial prioritization strongly modified conservation priorities and the modified priorities were robust to uncertain climate change. Setting conservation priorities based on habitat quality and connectivity maintained a large proportion of the region's connectivity, despite anticipated habitat loss due to climate and land-use change. The application of connectivity criteria alongside habitat-quality criteria for protected-area design was efficient with respect to the amount of area that needs protection and did not necessarily amplify trade-offs among conservation criteria. Our approach and results are being applied in and around Montreal and are well suited to the design of ecological networks and green infrastructure for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services in other regions, in particular regions around large cities, where connectivity is critically low. © 2017 Society for Conservation Biology","biodiversidad; biodiversity; corredores; corridors; fragmentación de hábitat; graph theory; habitat fragmentation; metapoblación; metapopulation; modelos de distribución de especies; species distribution models; teoría de gráficos; zonación; zonation","Animal Distribution; Animals; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Models, Biological; Quebec; Vertebrates; Canada; Montreal; Quebec [Canada]; Vertebrata; biodiversity; climate change; connectivity; conservation management; ecological zonation; ecosystem service; graphical method; habitat availability; habitat corridor; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; habitat quality; land use change; metapopulation; network analysis; periurban area; prioritization; protected area; spatial distribution; trade-off; vertebrate; animal; animal dispersal; biodiversity; biological model; climate change; environmental protection; forest; Quebec; vertebrate","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026476224"

Thus, selection of the best species for cultivation in semiarid and arid climates is fundamental. Salvadora persica is an evergreen perennial halophyte that can grow under extreme conditions, from very dry environments to highly saline soils. Based on international bibliography, the authors outlined an agro-ecological zoning model to determine the potential cultivation zones for S. persica in Argentina. This model may be applied to any part of the world, using the agro-ecological limits presented in this work. All the maps were developed by the implementation of a geographic information system (GIS) that can be updated by the further incorporation of complementary information, with the consequent improvement of the original database. The overlap of the agroclimatic suitability map on the drylands' saline soils and the drylands' alkaline soils maps, determined the agro-ecological zoning. Since some areas in the agro-ecological zoning can overlap with land that is already assigned for other uses, protected areas, current land use/cover of the different zones, and urban areas maps were incorporated into the GIS and subtracted by a mask. This resulted in the delimitation of ""potential cultivation zoning"", thus avoiding possible conflicts surrounding the use of land and making the agro-ecological zonation more efficient. There is a broad agro-ecological zone for cultivation of S. persica that extends from Northern Argentina to approximately 41° South latitude, under dry-subhumid to semiarid climates. Lands classified with different degrees of suitability in the potential cultivation zoning could be used for production of this species for energy purposes on lands that are either unsuitable for food production or currently assigned for other purposes. This paper represents pioneering work since there are no previous studies concerning the introduction of S. persica in Argentina. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Agro-ecological zoning; Agroclimatic zoning; Argentina; Drylands' saline and alkaline soils; Non-traditional oilseed tree; Potential cultivation zoning; Salvadora persica; Subhumid to semiarid climates","Argentina; Biodegradation, Environmental; Desert Climate; Oil and Gas Fields; Salinity; Salvadoraceae; Soil; Argentina; Salvadora persica; Conservation; Ecology; Geographic information systems; Land use; Oils and fats; Soils; soil; Alkaline soils; Argentina; Non-traditional; Salvadora persica; Semi-arid climate; agroecology; crop production; cultivation; dryland farming; GIS; halophyte; saline soil; salinity; zoning system; agroecosystem; Argentina; Article; biofuel production; controlled study; environmental impact; geographic distribution; geographic information system; habitat selection; nonhuman; priority journal; salinity; Salvadora persica; semiarid climate; soil analysis; soil property; species introduction; tillage; urban area; zonation; bioremediation; chemistry; desert climate; oil and gas field; physiology; Salvadoraceae; soil; Zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941142402"

The region hosts contract areas for the exploration of polymetallic nodules and Areas of Particular Environmental Interest (APEI) as protected areas. In order to assess the impact of potential mining on these deep-sea sediments and ecosystems, a thorough determination of the natural spatial variability of depositional and geochemical conditions as well as biogeochemical processes and element fluxes in the different exploration areas is required. Here, we present a comparative study on (1) sedimentation rates and bioturbation depths, (2) redox zonation of the sediments and element fluxes as well as (3) rates and pathways of biogeochemical reactions at six sites in the eastern CCZ. The sites are located in four European contract areas and in the APEI3. Our results demonstrate that the natural spatial variability of depositional and (bio)geochemical conditions in this deep-sea sedimentary environment is much larger than previously thought. We found that the OPD varies between 1 and 4.5 m, while the sediments at two sites are oxic throughout the sampled interval (7.5 m depth). Below the OPD, manganese and nitrate reduction occur concurrently in the suboxic zone with pore-water Mn2+ concentrations of up to 25 µM. The thickness of the suboxic zone extends over depth intervals of less than 3 m to more than 8 m. Our data and the applied transport-reaction model suggest that the extension of the oxic and suboxic zones is ultimately determined by the (1) low flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) of 1–2 mg Corg m−2 d−1 to the seafloor, (2) low sedimentation rates between 0.2 and 1.15 cm kyr−1 and (3) oxidation of pore-water Mn2+ at depth. The diagenetic model reveals that aerobic respiration is the main biogeochemical process driving OM degradation. Due to very low POC fluxes of 1 mg Corg m−2 d−1 to the seafloor at the site investigated in the protected APEI3 area, respiration rates are twofold lower than at the other study sites. Thus, the APEI3 site does not represent the (bio)geochemical conditions that prevail in the other investigated sites located in the European contract areas. Lateral variations in surface water productivity are generally reflected in the POC fluxes to the seafloor across the various areas but deviate from this trend at two of the study sites. We suggest that the observed spatial variations in depositional and (bio)geochemical conditions result from differences in the degree of degradation of OM in the water column and heterogeneous sedimentation patterns caused by the interaction of bottom water currents with seafloor topography. © 2018 The Authors","Biogeochemical processes; CCZ; Deep-sea sediments; Eastern equatorial Pacific; Manganese nodule belt; Oxygen penetration depth; Redox zonation","Clarion Fracture Zone; Clipperton Fracture Zone; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East); Biogeochemistry; Conservation; Manganese compounds; Manganese nodules; Manganese removal (water treatment); Oceanography; Organic carbon; Oxic sediments; Reaction rates; Redox reactions; Sedimentation; Surface waters; Water; Biogeochemical process; Deep sea sediment; Eastern equatorial Pacific; Oxygen penetration; Redox zonation; abyssal plain; biogeochemistry; bioturbation; deep-sea sediment; depositional environment; fracture zone; manganese nodule; organic matter; oxygen; particulate organic carbon; protected area; redox conditions; seamount; sedimentation; spatial variation; Deep sea mining","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052989620"

The core concept for designing protected area (PA) networks is the CAR principle, which comprises Comprehensiveness, Adequacy, and Representativeness. This is the basis of conservation planning, involving the identification of potential biodiversity patterns within a PA network as sampled areas. Priority areas for implementing conservation targets are identified in a spatially explicit manner, based on site-selection algorithms using biodiversity features and socioeconomic cost layers. Site-selection algorithms have roots in the concept of complementarity, which is related to ecological/evolutionary distinctiveness and the spatial turnover of biodiversity features among sites. Complementarity is a conceptual attribute of siteselection algorithms used to explore the minimum-set problem. Irreplaceability constitutes an index of conservation priority, and it is informative to associate the irreplaceability score with threat/vulnerability levels among sites when using a reactive conservation approach. Spatial prioritization of the Zonation algorithm is a promising tool for defining conservation targets recursively, and enables us to prioritize ranking for minimizing biodiversity loss under socioeconomic constraints. The concept of persistence is an important one for the future development of SCP, which currently assumes static biodiversity patterns. Incorporating macroecological patterns and underlying processes into the CAR principle is critical for maintaining biogeographical potential in conservation planning. © 2017, Tohoku University.

Sustainable management of forest resources is required to ensure continued supply of these benefits, but complex social-ecological processes are often a constraint to the design of such forest management strategies. In this study, we developed a model of adaptive forest zonation to facilitate forest ecosystem management. We employed the ecosystem services concept and a land-use change model to identify potential areas for conservation and for economic use in the Kapuas Protected Forest Management Unit in Indonesia. Local people actively participated in this study to jointly define management zones and stakeholders’ associated rights and responsibilities. Our results show that a stakeholder agreement facilitated the reduction of threats to forest ecosystems and increased local awareness of the need for forest ecosystem conservation. Compared to current forest zonation, we show that the availability of an economic development zone in adaptive forest zonation could potentially increase ecosystem benefits for local communities by about 40% through rattan and jelutong collection and agroforestry rubber and jelutong production. Although our results are specific for the Kapuas District, the methodology of adaptive forest zonation can be applied more generally. We recommend our methods be included in guidelines for zonation and management plans to help improve sustainable forest management practices of all forest management units in Indonesia. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Central Kalimantan; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem services; Forest management unit; Land-use; Peat forest ecosystems","Central Kalimantan; Indonesia; Calamus rotang; Dyera costulata; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; forest ecosystem; forest management; land use planning; protected area; trade-off; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045013780"

Its implementation has led to the re-territorialisation of 66 biosphere reserves, as they have been extended beyond the protected areas that form their ‘core areas’. One example is Wester Ross in northwest Scotland. This region has been nationally recognised for its high biodiversity and landscape values since the late 1940s, and a small biosphere reserve was established in 1976. In the current decade, as required by the MAB Programme, this biosphere reserve was extended to over 100 times its original area through a participatory process which is described in detail. Following re-territorialisation, this biosphere reserve, like others, both represents opportunities and faces challenges.

Taking into consideration the mountainous topography of the study area, the watershed was chosen as the planning unit, and ecotope mapping was carried out to identify topographic and biological features. For the evaluation of the state of recent use, the trail index and the distribution status of tour and management facilities were used. These features were processed using Marxan with Zones. As a result, the optimal solution of scenario 1 was selected as the final one following detailed verification of the area ratio and grouping of the Park Nature Conservation Area (zone A, 76.7%) and the Park Nature Environment Area (I) (zone B, 14.3%), the inclusion ratio of biotope grade I (95.2%) and the satisfied shortfall value of the conservation indicators. In the overlap analysis between the optimal solution and recent zonation, most of the features included in the suggested scenario were found to be correctly distributed according to the intensity of conservation. Furthermore, the northern parts of the watershed which include sub-alpine vegetation with the Baekdudaegan ridge as its ecological axis was newly separated into the Park Conservation Area.

Their efforts to use natural sources often collide with wildlife attacks. These animals do not only protect their natural environment, but in the face of losing the potential food sources, they also penetrate in human settlements. The research was situated in the Chitwan National Park (CNP) in Nepal, and the aim of this study was to investigate possible geospatial connections between attacks of all kinds of animals on humans in the CNP and its surroundings between 2003 and 2013. The patterns of attacks were significantly uneven across the months, and 89% of attacks occurred outside the park. In total, 74% attacks occurred in the buffer zone forests and croplands within 1 km from the park. There was a strong positive correlation among the number of victims for all attacking animals with a maximum of one victim per 4 km2, except elephant and wild boar. The density of bear victims was higher where the tiger and rhino victims were lower, e.g., in the Madi valley. The data collected during this period did not show any signs of spatial autocorrelation. The calculated magnitude per unit area using the kernel density, together with purpose-defined land use groups, were used to determine five risk zones of wildlife attacks. In conclusion, it was found that the riskiest areas were locations near the forest that were covered by agricultural land and inhabited by humans. Our research results can support any local spatial decision-making processes for improving the co-existence of natural protection in the park and the safety of human communities living in its vicinity. © 2018 by the authors.","Kernel density; Protected area management; Risk zonation; Safety analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053676978"

Optimising PA placement in the landscape is challenging due to a poor knowledge of biodiversity distribution and multiple definitions of conservation value. We explore these two issues using a case study of a highly threatened bird Order in a region of conservation concern where PA network effectiveness for biodiversity has not been formally explored previously. To determine if the existing PA network protects the most important areas for 24 species of Himalayan Galliformes, we use a novel method to compare the current network placement to results produced from Zonation prioritisation software and modelled species distributions. Specifically, we identify areas of high species richness and then weight maps by three different species specific conservation values. The current PA network captures ranges poorly. We found statistically significantly poorer fits between the optimal and the existing placement of the Himalayan PA network for Zonation results that were: (i) unweighted; (ii) weighted by Red List score; and (iii) weighted by endemism to the Himalaya. Across these and two other Zonation results, the placement of the optimal PA network covered 58% more of Galliformes distributions than the existing network. We advocate some refinements to the existing PA network to maximise Galliformes coverage and suggest that our method could be used to model the optimal PA network for a wide range of species and/or regions, something which will support the assessment and attainment of CBD targets. © 2016.Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Conservation priority-setting; Degazettement; Maxent; Species distribution modelling","Himalayas; Aves; Galliformes; biodiversity; bird; conservation management; endangered species; endemism; optimization; protected area; Red List; software; species conservation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957831147"

Biosphere Reserves attempt to reconcile environmental protection with sustainable development; they explicitly acknowledge humans, and human interests in the conservation landscape while still maintaining the ecological values of existing protected areas. Conceptually, this model is attractive, with 610 sites currently designated globally. Yet the practical reality of implementing dual 'conservation' and 'development' goals is challenging, with few examples successfully conforming to the model's full criteria. Here, we review the history of Biosphere Reserves from first inception in 1974 to the current status quo, and examine the suitability of the designation as an effective conservation model. We track the spatial expansion of Biosphere Reserves globally, assessing the influence of the Statutory Framework of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves and Seville strategy in 1995, when the BR concept refocused its core objectives on sustainable development. We use a comprehensive range of case studies to discuss conformity to the Programme, the social and ecological consequences associated with implementation of the designation, and challenges in aligning conservation and development. Given that the 'Biosphere Reserve' label is a relatively unknown designation in the public arena, this review also provides details on popularising the Biosphere Reserve brand, as well as prospects for further research, currently unexploited, but implicit in the designation. © 2013 Cambridge Philosophical Society.","Biodiversity conservation; Interdisciplinary science; Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB); Protected areas; Socio-ecological systems; Spatial zonation; Sustainable development; Trade-offs; UNESCO","Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Research; United Nations; animal; ecosystem; environmental protection; history; legislation and jurisprudence; procedures; research; United Nations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84891658575"

Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) are sites of international significance for birds identified by BirdLife International. Here, we perform EU-wide terrestrial spatial conservation prioritizations to evaluate the coverage of IBAs by SPAs, and the coverage of bird and other vertebrate distributions by IBAs and SPAs. We then investigate the distribution of potential locations for expanding the SPA network that maximize bird species' representation, and the coverage of these locations by IBAs. On average, SPAs cover 23% of the EU-wide distribution of each bird species and 25% of the distributions of amphibians, reptiles and mammals together, while IBAs provide marginally greater coverage. Overall, 76% of terrestrial IBAs in the EU are completely or partially covered by SPAs, and 66% of the IBA network area is covered by SPAs. Our results suggest that SPA designation has been significantly informed by data on the location of IBAs. While IBAs are identified using data on particular bird species of conservation concern, they also tend to have high EU-wide representation of other vertebrates. The designation of new or expanded SPAs covering a relatively small amount of currently unprotected land (particularly in the southern EU) would substantially increase SPA coverage of bird species ranges. Our analysis provides insights on the current contribution that these sites make to conserving vertebrates across the EU, and future possibilities for efficiently expanding the network. © 2016 The Authors","Birds Directive; Natura 2000 network; Protected area network expansion; Spatial conservation prioritization; Systematic conservation planning; Zonation software","Amphibia; Aves; Mammalia; Reptilia; Vertebrata; biodiversity; bird; conservation management; conservation planning; European Union; population distribution; prioritization; protected area; software; spatial distribution; species conservation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84989957322"

Although progress in expanding the coverage of MPAs has been made, the application of management tools has not yet been implemented in most of these areas. In this work, distribution models were applied to nine benthic habitats on a Mediterranean seamount within an MPA for conservation purposes. Benthic habitat occurrences were identified from 55 remotely operated vehicle (ROV) transects, at depths from 76 to 700 m, and data derived from multibeam bathymetry. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were applied to link the presence of each benthic habitat to local environmental proxies (depth, slope, backscatter, aspect, and bathymetric position index, BPI). The main environmental drivers of habitat distribution were depth, slope, and BPI. Based on this result, five different geomorphological areas were distinguished. A full coverage map indicating the potential benthic habitat distribution on the seamount was obtained to inform spatial management. The distribution of those habitats identified as vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) was used to make recommendations on zonation for developing the management plan of the MPA. This process reveals itself as an appropriate methodological approach that can be developed in other areas of the Natura 2000 marine network. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","benthic habitat; generalized additive models; mapping; marine protected area; seamount; spatial management","Mediterranean Sea; benthos; conservation management; ecological modeling; habitat management; habitat structure; implementation process; management practice; mapping method; marine ecosystem; nature conservation; protected area; remotely operated vehicle; seamount","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065260021"

Broad bathymetric zones are defined by visible substratum characteristics, and by cluster analysis using presence/absence of identified fauna. The shelf edge and upper slope (to 350 m depth) showed current-swept coarse substrata with a very sparse fauna. A transition to finer sandy sediments was apparent at 350-470 m, with a greater abundance of mobile epifauna. The brittlestar Ophiocten gracilis occurred at high density below 600 m depth in all three areas. Southern stations indicated an abrupt lower boundary for this zone at ca 1000 m. In the north, rippled sands with xenophyophores occurred below the O. gracilis zone at 1000-1100 m. Xenophyophores were also seen in smaller numbers at this depth in the south. From ∼1300-1600 m a seabed of burrowed fine mud was recorded in both northern and southern areas.

We applied current approaches in conservation planning to prioritize California watersheds for management of biodiversity. For all watersheds, we compiled data on the presence/ absence of herpetofauna and fishes; observations of freshwater-dependent mammals, selected invertebrates, and plants; maps of freshwater habitat types; measures of habitat condition and vulnerability; and current management status. We analyzed species-distribution data to identify areas of high freshwater conservation value that optimized representation of target taxa on the landscape and leveraged existing protected areas. The resulting priority network encompasses 34% of the area of California and includes ≥10% of the geographic range for all target taxa. High-value watersheds supported nontarget freshwater taxa and habitats, and focusing on target taxa may provide broad conservation value. Most of the priority conservation network occurs on public lands (69% by area), and 46% overlaps with protected areas already managed for biodiversity. A significant proportion of the network area is on private land and underscores the value of programs that incentivize landowners to manage freshwater species and habitats. The priority conservation areas encompass more freshwater habitats/ha than existing protected areas. Land use (agriculture and urbanization), altered fire regimes, nonnative fish communities, and flow impairment are the most important threats to freshwater habitat in the priority network, whereas factors associated with changing climate are the key drivers of habitat vulnerability. Our study is a guide to a comprehensive approach to freshwater conservation currently lacking in California. Conservation resources are often limited, so prioritization tools are valuable assets to land and water managers. © 2018 by The Society for Freshwater Science.","California; Conservation planning; Freshwater biodiversity; Protected areas; Zonation software","California; United States; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Pisces; biodiversity; climate change; conservation management; conservation planning; fish; freshwater ecosystem; freshwater environment; herpetofauna; invertebrate; mammal; plant; prioritization; private land; protected area; software; watershed","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045613191"

The ""climate change vulnerability score"" (CCVS) is an aggregation of six autecological traits that are known to be associated with vulnerability to CC: endemism, micro-endemism, temperature preference, altitudinal preference, stream zonation preference, and life history. We assigned a vulnerability score (0 - invulnerable to 6 - highly vulnerable to climate change) to 1940 EPT species and discussed the applicability of the index at three spatial scales: (1) continental (Europe), (2) state (the German Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia) and (3) a river basin (the Ruhr River). We identified 157 EPT species (ca. 8%) as highly vulnerable to climate change (CCVS ≥ 4), including 95 species of caddisflies, 60 species of stoneflies and two species of mayflies. These are mostly found in France and Italy (52 species each), Spain and Slovenia (36 and 34, respectively), and Austria and Switzerland (30 species each), of which 95 are caddisflies, 60 stoneflies, and 2 mayflies. Using data collected in routine regional sampling we show that although no endemic EPTs were found in the German Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, eight species can still be identified as relatively vulnerable to CC (CCVS of 3). Almost all of these species are occurring in the 'mountainous' regions of the state (>200 m a.s.l.), the Sauerland and the Eifel. The upper reaches of the Ruhr catchment have been found to be relatively rich in vulnerable species, including several locally rare species. This index can assist conservationists to identify ""hotspots"" in terms of climate vulnerability and climate change refuge areas that can be considered for protection or the application of restoration measures at a local and regional scale. Nevertheless, not all species have complete autecological information, which hinders our ability to fully recognize the areas of priority. To further stabilize and enhance the applicability of this method, it is essential to fill these knowledge gaps in the future. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we used a combination of species distribution modelling (SDM) and spatial hierarchical systematic conservation planning technique to delineate and prioritize areas for endemic plant species conservation under current and future (2050s, 2070s) climate conditions in Sikkim Himalaya. Data on endemic plant species occurrence were sourced from our already published studies and their potential suitable habitats under current and future climates were modelled using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) SDM. The MaxEnt habitat suitability projections of species were used in Zonation software to identify priority conservation areas in Sikkim Himalaya. We found that the existing PA network in the region was inadequate in conserving the endemic plant diversity either in the current or future climate scenarios. Based on our results, we propose addition of 896 square kilometres (sq km) to the existing PA network in the study area to ensure meaningful conservation goals. Additionally, we propose creation of 3 new PAs (Yumsedong, Lachen and Chungthang) and the need for expanding the boundaries of existing PAs (Maenam, Fambong Lho and Barsey) in the study area. Our analyses show that to mitigate the effects of ensuing climate change, a single large PA with wide geographic and elevational extents instead of several smaller PAs would be a more prudent strategy for conserving the plant diversity in the Himalaya. © 2019","Climate change; Conservation; Endemic plants; Himalaya; Protected areas","Himalayas; India; Lachen; Sikkim; Sikkim Himalayas; biodiversity; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; conservation management; conservation planning; ecological modeling; ecosystem function; endemic species; future prospect; identification method; plant; prioritization; protected area; species conservation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062279966"

U.S. private land policy is generally implemented by local governments through comprehensive plans and zoning ordinances. While most cities have adopted these policies many non-metropolitan jurisdictions remain unzoned. In this study we investigated factors predicting zoning adoption in rural and exurban Michigan townships. Results from a logit model showed that likelihood of zoning adoption between 1998 and 2003 was higher for townships with more developed land, fewer conservative voters, higher household income, more zoned neighbors, and township-level planning rather than county-level planning. We quantified thresholds at which development levels correlated with zoning adoption. Overall, townships had greater than a 50% probability of adopting zoning when 9% or more of their land base had been developed, but this threshold was higher in townships with no planning (12%) and highest where planning was implemented at the county level (19%). In high-growth townships forestland was negatively correlated with zoning adoption. However, model results showed socioeconomic variables to be better predictors of zoning adoption than natural resource variables. These results highlight the importance that planning and zoning occur at the same level of government, and the importance of multiple policy options in jurisdictions unlikely to adopt zoning. Gaining insight into reasons for land-use policy adoption, or lack thereof, is important for achieving common planning goals, including preserving rural livelihoods, conserving forests and farmlands, and maintaining rural landscape characteristics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Land use; Local government; Planning; Policy adoption; Private land; Zoning","Conservation; Land Use; Probability; Michigan; United States; Conservation; Economics; Forestry; Land use; Logistic regression; Natural resources; Planning; Public policy; Rural areas; Gaining insights; Household income; Land conservation; Local government; Policy adoption; Private land; Rural landscapes; Rural livelihood; landscape planning; local government; private land; rural landscape; rural population; socioeconomic conditions; town planning; zonation; zoning policy; Zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84910019811"

Sophisticated conservation planning and assessment tools developed to identify locations for new protected areas can provide an evidence base for such prioritisations, yet decision-makers in many countries lack the institutional support and necessary capacity to use the associated software. As such, simple heuristic approaches such as species richness or number of threatened species are generally adopted to inform prioritisation decisions. However, their performance has never been tested. Using the reptile fauna of Madagascar's dry forests as a case study, we evaluate the performance of four site prioritisation protocols used to rank the conservation value of 22 established and candidate protected areas. We compare the results to a benchmark produced by the widely-used systematic conservation planning software Zonation. The four indices scored sites on the basis of: i) species richness; ii) an index based on species' Red List status; iii) irreplaceability (a key metric in systematic conservation planning); and, iv) a novel Conservation Value Index (CVI), which incorporates species-level information on endemism, representation in the protected area system, tolerance of habitat degradation and hunting/collection pressure. Rankings produced by the four protocols were positively correlated to the results of Zonation, particularly amongst high-scoring sites, but CVI and Irreplaceability performed better than Species Richness and the Red List Index. Given the technological capacity constraints experienced by decision-makers in the developing world, our findings suggest that heuristic metrics can represent a useful alternative to more sophisticated analyses, especially when they integrate species-specific information related to extinction risk. However, this can require access to, and understanding of, more complex species data. © 2015 Gardner et al.","","Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Desiccation; Forests; Geography; Investments; Madagascar; Reptiles; Species Specificity; animal hunting; Article; computer program; controlled study; developing country; endangered species; environmental management; environmental protection; fauna; forest; habitat; intermethod comparison; investment; Madagascar; nonhuman; reptile; species difference; species endemicity; species extinction; species richness; animal; comparative study; desiccation; economics; environmental protection; forest; geography; physiology; reptile","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941333950"

Additionally, the influence of seafloor variables on the observed distribution patterns was evaluated. Highest sponge densities and abundances were concentrated in areas of high hydrodynamism, namely the rocky shoals offshore Cap Formentor and the Menorca Canyon's head. Most of the studied species were dominated by small to medium size classes, suggesting pulse recruitment events. A clear depth-zonation pattern has been observed, going from the inner continental shelf to the upper slope. At the same time, the continental shelf harbored the presence of diverse and contrasting growth morphologies, yet the biggest forms occurred at the shelf edge and the upper slope.

Here, using the distributions of 102 biodiversity features and 7 extractive uses we trial the systematic conservation planning software Zonation as a decision-support tool to facilitate progress towards New Zealand's commitment to establishing a representative network of MPAs while providing for economic development. Our results indicate that: (i) New Zealand's existing MPAs provide on average 70% less representation of the input biodiversity features than would be achieved by an MPA network of equivalent area designed from the outset using Zonation; (ii) small increases in the geographic extent of existing protection results in rapid increases in representation of the selected biodiversity features when systematic conservation planning software is used to inform expansion of existing protection; and (iii) the impacts on existing resource users of an expanded MPA system can be minimized by using Zonation to identify areas that increase biodiversity representation, while avoiding areas where existing uses may be incompatible with marine protection. These results demonstrate the utility of systematic conservation planning software as a decision-support tool within a broader social process for MPA network design and implementation. The iterative application of tools such as Zonation during participatory processes that balance alternative uses could potentially lead to more informed, efficient and socially enduring outcomes that enhance the ability to establish representative MPA networks. © 2017 Department of Conservation","Biodiversity representation; Decision support tool; MPAs; Participatory approach; Systematic conservation planning; Zonation software","New Zealand; biodiversity; conservation planning; decision support system; economic planning; network design; participatory approach; protected area; software; zonation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018504622"

The paper assesses the governance and management system’s potential as an exemplar to protected areas practitioners, and discusses how such a system might be initiated and replicated elsewhere in the country and the region. Five building blocks of an experimental collaborative governance model are described. These comprise: (i) a participatory governance assessment; (ii) establishing a multi-level collaborative management and governance structure; (iii) participatory zonation based on traditional knowledge and customary rights; (iv) drafting collaborative governance agreements and (v) involving local people as additional protected area management manpower. The inter-linkages between these building blocks are also described. The first results of the collaborative governance approach are encouraging as the total management effectiveness score increased by 13 per cent in two years. It shows that the collaborative governance model can deliver positive results for the entire protected area system in Lao PDR, which is often referred to as a ‘paper park system’. Further work on adaptive management of the collaborative governance system and sustainable financing of the technical field programmes will be required to sustain this model. © 2016, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

The modelled distribution for current suitable conditions for each species was projected into the future at three time slices using two emission scenarios from four global circulation models and under two assumptions of dispersal ability. Climate change is expected to vary in its effects spatially, with some areas characterized by increased species richness while others show declines. Future range changes vary among species and different future projections, from the entire loss to large gains in range. Two species were expected to become extinct in at least one future projection, and eight species were expected to lose >80% of their current distribution.

We evaluated an underexplored dimension of the mismatch between climate and biota: limitations to forest growth and succession affecting habitat suitability. Our objective was to inform continental-scale conservation for boreal songbirds under disequilibria between climate, vegetation and fauna. Location: Boreal and southern arctic ecoregions of North America. Methods: We used forest inventory and avian survey data to classify 53 species by seral-stage affinity and applied these to generate alternative projections of changes in species' core habitat distributions based on different vegetation lag-time assumptions. We used our seral stage-modified refugia approach and the Zonation algorithm to identify multispecies boreal conservation priorities over the 21st century. We evaluated the sensitivity of land rankings to seral-stage affinity and species' weights and assessed the conservation value of the existing protected areas network compared to Zonation results. Results: End-of-century projected changes in songbird distribution were reduced by up to 169% when vegetation lags were considered. Zonation land rankings based on unconstrained climate projections were concentrated at high latitudes, whereas those based on strict and modified refugia scenarios were concentrated in coastal and high-elevation areas, as well as biome transition zones, which were fairly consistent over time and species weights. The existing protected areas network covering 14% of the study area was estimated to conserve 12-14% of baseline avian biodiversity across time periods and scenarios, compared to 16-25% for top-ranked Zonation areas. Main conclusions: For some boreal songbirds, limits to forest growth and succession may result in dramatic reductions in suitable habitat over the next century. Our seral stage-adjusted approach provides conservative and efficient boreal conservation priorities anchored around climatic macrorefugia that are robust to century-long climate change and complement the current protected areas network. 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Boreal forest; Climate change; Conservation planning; Refugia; Songbirds; Species distribution models","Arctic; North America; Aves; Passeri; biodiversity; biome; boreal forest; climate change; community structure; conservation management; conservation planning; growth rate; population distribution; protected area; refuge; songbird; succession; vegetation structure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939774603"

Location: Global. Methods: We compare the coverage of species when global priority areas for conservation are identified based on (1) twelve species richness maps of all and small-range amphibians, birds and mammals and all and small-range threatened (i.e., vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered) species; (2) weighted range size rarity, a richness measure corrected for range size; and (3) a complementarity-based analysis including species range maps for 21,075 terrestrial vertebrate species listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. We also assessed whether any combination of small-range and/or threatened species richness could be a suitable surrogate for a complementarity-based analysis by assessing species coverage in priority areas located using (1) richness of small-range species only; (2) richness of all threatened species only; and (3) richness of small-range and threatened species. Results: Our results show clear differences in the spatial pattern of priority areas for conservation among the prioritizations based on species richness, weighted range size rarity and species range maps, with the species richness-based priority areas being highly aggregated in the tropics and the species range map priority areas being more evenly spread among the global terrestrial area. We also find that identifying priority areas for conservation using species richness produces a lower coverage of species than priority areas based on complementarity methods and identified using species range maps, where just one species was left without any protection. Main Conclusions: As methods and software currently exist for processing large numbers of individual species distribution maps in spatial prioritization, the use of species richness appears to be an unnecessary simplification of biodiversity pattern. © 2017 The Authors.

Transparent scientific approaches are needed to ensure that these encompass areas with high biodiversity value. Here we used the distribution of all globally threatened seabirds breeding in a centrally located archipelago (Tristan da Cunha) to provide guidance on where MPAs could be established in the South Atlantic Ocean. We combined year-round tracking data from six species, and used the systematic conservation-planning tool, ‘Zonation’, to delineate areas that would protect the largest proportion of each population. The areas used most intensively varied among species and seasons. Combining the sites used by all six species suggested that the most important areas of the South Atlantic are located south of South Africa, around the central South Atlantic between 30°S and 55°S, and near South America. We estimated that the longline fishing effort in these intensively used areas is around 11 million hooks on average each year, highlighting the need for improved monitoring of seabird bycatch rates and the enforcement of compliance with bird bycatch mitigation requirements by fisheries. There was no overlap between the identified areas and any of the existing MPAs in the South Atlantic. The conservation of these highly mobile, pelagic species cannot be achieved by single countries, but requires a multi-national approach at an ocean-basin scale, such as an agreement for the conservation of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction under the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea. © 2017","Important bird and biodiversity areas; Marine Protected Areas; Seabirds; Threatened species; Tristan da Cunha","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (South); Saint Helena; South Africa; South America; Tristan da Cunha; Aves; biodiversity; bycatch; conservation status; endangered species; fishing effort; global ocean; Law of the Sea; marine park; pelagic environment; prioritization; protected area; seabird; zonation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019172231"

We used a multi-model ensemble forecasting approach, on 8 years of at-sea censuses of 30 seabird species to identify candidate MPAs in the Portuguese coast, prioritizing important areas for their conservation based on their occurrence and distribution. We overlapped the outputs generated by the Ensemble Ecological Niche Models (EENMs) with layers representing important environmental stressors (fishing intensity, ship density and oil pollution risk), and calculated loss in conservation value using them as cost layers. Three key marine areas were identified along the Portuguese coast: For breeders, there was a key marine area encompassing the Tagus and Sado estuaries and Berlengas archipelago; for non-breeders and migratory species two important areas were identified in the Northern and Southern coast. The key marine area identified in the Northern coast is characterized by high productivity and biodiversity, and can be affected by oil pollution from the refineries and the intensive ship traffic in this area. Also, the area identified in the Southern coast of Portugal for migratory seabirds overlaps extensively with areas of high fishing activity. Our results show that the Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) established along the Portuguese coast protect more than a third of the areas that we prioritized for breeding species and the official MPAs near 65% of the same areas. In contrast, current IBAs and national legislation protect less than 4% of the coastal areas that we prioritize for non-breeding species in this study. Our study, combining multi-species distribution with environmental constraints induced by human activities, allowed us to assess the coherence of the Portuguese marine planning and identify candidate areas to join the Portuguese network of marine protected areas. Our results, employing data from annual at-sea surveys together with the human stressors known to affect the Portuguese coast, proved to be an extremely useful strategy to identify spatial conservation areas along the Portuguese coast as well as to access the adequacy and consistency of those areas. Despite the constraints of this demanding approach, we are confident that our study provides a reliable strategy to inform marine conservation efforts and management planning in similar coastal environments elsewhere, characterized by strong coastal upwelling movements. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ensemble Ecological Niche Models; Environmental stressors; European seabirds at-sea census; Marine protected areas; Zonation software","Portugal; Aves; Biodiversity; Coastal engineering; Coastal zones; Ecology; Environmental protection; Fisheries; Marine pollution; Pollution; Population distribution; Ships; Surveys; Waterway transportation; Ecological niche models; Environmental constraints; Environmental stressors; European seabirds at-sea census; Marine conservations; Marine protected area; National legislation; Occurrence and distribution; biodiversity; ensemble forecasting; environmental stress; marine park; migratory species; niche partitioning; oil pollution; seabird; software; upwelling; Conservation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038811599"

First, we quantified species' representation in the network, and compared it against outcomes of hypothetical optimal planning scenarios at the EU, member state, and biogeographical levels. Second, we examined the spatial configuration of N2k sites and same-sized hypothetical top priority sites based on the three planning scenarios. We found that N2k covered all vertebrate directive species, and the coverage was significantly better than with a random allocation of sites. We observed substantial differences in representation between taxa, followed by the fact that N2k succeeded better in covering threatened and directive species than non-directive species. The current species representation in N2k was closer to optimal allocations done at member states' or biogeographical levels than the EU-wide allocation. Furthermore, the N2k sites overlapped more with the EU-wide allocation and they were more evenly distributed across the EU compared to sites in all hypothetical optimal allocations. Finally, we found that the biogeographical scenario covered well the ranges of habitats directive species, following the biogeographical approach taken by the EU in the Habitats Directive.

However, a comprehensive regional and global network should be designed to be representative of all aspects of biodiversity, including populations, species, and biogenic habitats. A good exemplar would be the Coral Triangle (CT) because it is the most species rich area in the ocean but only 2% of its area is in any kind of MPA. Our analysis consisted of five different groups of layers of biodiversity features: biogenic habitat, species richness, species of special conservation concern, restricted range species, and areas of importance for sea turtles. We utilized the systematic conservation planning software Zonation as a decision-support tool to ensure representation of biodiversity features while balancing selection of protected areas based on the likelihood of threats. Our results indicated that the average representation of biodiversity features within the existing MPA system is currently about 5%. By systematically increasing MPA coverage to 10% of the total area of the CT, the average representation of biodiversity features within the MPA system would increase to over 37%. Marine areas in the Halmahera Sea, the outer island arc of the Banda Sea, the Sulu Archipelago, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Malaita Islands were identified as priority areas for the designation of new MPAs. Moreover, we recommended that several existing MPAs be expanded to cover additional biodiversity features within their adjacent areas, including MPAs in Indonesia (e.g., in the Birds Head of Papua), the Philippines (e.g., in the northwestern part of the Sibuyan Sea), Malaysia (e.g., in the northern part of Sabah), Papua New Guinea (e.g., in the Milne Bay Province), and the Solomon Islands (e.g., around Santa Isabel Island). An MPA system that covered 30% of the CT would include 65% of the biodiversity features. That just two-thirds of biodiversity was represented by one-third of the study area supports calls for at least 30% of the ocean to be in no-fishing MPA. This assessment provides a blueprint for efficient gains in marine conservation through the extension of the current MPA system in the CT region. Moreover, similar data could be compiled for other regions, and globally, to design ecologically representative MPAs. © 2018 Asaad, Lundquist, Erdmann, Van Hooidonk and Costello.","Biodiversity conservation; Coral Triangle; Ecological criteria; Marine protected area; Spatial prioritizations","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056137759"

While these species are primarily selected as “flagships” for marketing campaigns, it is important to evaluate their surrogacy potential, i.e. the extent to which their protection benefits other biodiversity elements. Four charismatic megafauna species are used as surrogates in the megadiverse island of Sumatra: the Sumatran tiger Panthera tigris sumatrae, Sumatran elephant Elephas maximus sumatranus, Sumatran orangutan Pongo abelii and Sumatran rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis. We examined how well each of these species performed in representing the distribution of all co-occurring terrestrial mammal species on the island, and the priority areas for the conservation of three facets of mammalian biodiversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional). We used habitat suitability models to represent the distribution of 184 terrestrial mammal species, 160 phylogenetic groups and 74 functional trait groups. We then identified priority conservation areas using the spatial prioritisation software Zonation. We found that the habitat overlap between each of the four charismatic species and the other mammal species varied, ranging from a mean of 52% (SD = 27%) for the tiger to 2% (SD = 2%) for the rhino. Combining the four species together improved the representation levels only marginally compared to using the tiger only. Among the four charismatic megafauna species, the extent of suitable habitat of Sumatran tiger covered the highest proportion of priority conservation areas. The Sumatran tiger also outperformed most of other mammal species with similar range sizes. We found that some of the top-ranked conservation areas for taxonomic (28%), phylogenetic (8%) and functional diversity (19%) did not overlap with any of the charismatic species’ suitable habitat. Synthesis and applications. Wide-ranging charismatic species can represent broader mammalian biodiversity, but they may miss some key areas with high biodiversity importance. We suggest that a combination of systematic spatial prioritisation and surrogacy analyses are important in order to determine the allocation of conservation resources in biodiversity-rich areas such as Sumatra, where an expansion of the protected area network is required. © 2019 The Authors.

Yet, the planning of species conservation should go hand-in-hand with the planning and management of (new) protected areas. iLynx lynx martinoi/i has a small, fragmented distribution with a small total population size and an endangered population. This study combines species distribution modelling with spatial prioritisation techniques to identify conservation areas for iLynx lynx martinoi/i. The aim was to determine locations of high probability of occurrence for the lynx, to potentially increase current protected areas by 20g¯% in Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. The species distribution modelling used generalised linear models with lynx occurrence and pseudo-Absence data. Two models were developed and fitted using the lynx data: one based on natural factors, and the second based on factors associated with human disturbance. The Zonation conservation planning software was then used to undertake spatial prioritisations of the landscape using the first model composed of natural factors as a biological feature, and (inverted) a second model composed of anthropological factors such as a cost layer. The first model included environmental factors as elevation, terrain ruggedness index, woodland and shrub land, and food factor as chamois prey (occurrences) and had a prediction accuracy of 82g¯%. Second model included anthropological factors as agricultural land and had a prediction accuracy of 65g¯%. Prioritised areas for extending protected areas for lynx conservation were found primarily in the Albania&ndash;Macedonia&ndash;Kosovo and Montenegro&ndash;Albania&ndash;Kosovo cross-border areas. We show how natural and human factors can be incorporated into spatially prioritising conservation areas on a landscape level. Our results show the importance of expanding the existing protected areas in cross-border areas of core lynx habitat. The priority of these cross-border areas highlight the importance international cooperation can play in designing and implementing a coherent and long-term conservation plan including a species conservation plan to securing the future of the lynx. © Author(s) 2016.","","Albania; Kosovo; Macedonia [Southern Europe]; Montenegro; Lynx; Rupicapra rupicapra; border region; conservation planning; ecosystem modeling; endangered species; felid; habitat; international cooperation; prioritization; protected area; species conservation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957808105"

Location: Japanese archipelago, Ryukyu archipelago and Izu-Bonin oceanic islands. Methods: We modelled the distributions of 6,325 species (amphibians, birds, freshwater fish, mammals, plants and reptiles) using 4,389,489 occurrence data points. We then applied the Zonation software for spatial conservation prioritization. First, we identified environmental drivers underpinning taxon-specific biodiversity patterns. Second, we analysed each taxon individually to understand baseline priority patterns. Third, we combined all taxa into an inclusive analysis to identify the most important PAN expansions. Results: Biodiversity patterns were well explained by geographical factors (climate, habitat stability, isolation and area), but their explanatory power differed between the taxa. There was remarkably little overlap between priority areas for the individual higher taxa. The inclusive prioritization analysis across all taxa identified priority regions, in particular in southern subtropical and mountainous areas. Expanding the PAN up to 17% would cover most of the ranges for rare and/or restricted-range species. On average, approximately 30% of the ranges of all species could be covered by the 17% expansion identified here. Main conclusions: Our analyses identified top candidates for the expansion of Japan's protected area network. Taxon-specific prioritization was informative for understanding the conservation priority patterns of different taxa associated with unique biogeographical processes. For the basis of PAN expansion, we recommend multi-taxon prioritization as an area-efficient compromise that reflects taxon-specific priority patterns. Spatial prioritization across multiple taxa provides a promising start for the development of conservation plans with the aim of long-term persistence of biodiversity on the East Asian islands. © 2018 The Authors.

It is a new trend that takes mathematical models as a tool to study the reserve design. Traditional mathematical models, such as the set covering species problem (SCSP) and the maximal covering species problem (MCSP), only consider to plan and design the reserve at the lowest cost. They do not consider spatial characteristics of the reserve, leading to over fragmentation of the selected areas for nature reserve. In addition, these methods only consider the price of land which cannot fully reflect the ecological value of the protected areas. This study uses the ecological value as indicators and associated with the spatial characteristics of continuity and compactness to construct an effective and reasonable model for nature reserve design. The proposed model was aimed to establish the nature reserve and provided a scientific basis for nature reserve establishment. 【Method】Taking Daiyun Mountain national nature reserve of Fujian Province as an example, we divided the reserve into 567 regular blocks. The area of each block was 2 km×2 km and each had several sub-compartments. Firstly, according to the scoring standards for ecological values and the weighting algorithm, the ecological value of sub-compartments and its associated blocks was calculated successively. Secondly, based on the special spatial characteristics and ecological values, the space-ecology set covering problem (SSCP) based on the tail length algorithm was constructed, and the effects of various combinations between the compactness with different weights and the percentage of protected species on overall performance of protected areas were discussed. Finally, the traditional SCSP model, the system protection planning tool Marxan model and the Zoning model were used as the control group to verify the validity of the SSCP model. 【Results】 From the perspective of spatial distribution, the design results of the protected area solved by SCSP model, Marxan model and Zonation model were as follows: the distribution of the blocks was discrete and the degree of fragmentation was high. In contrast, the design of the SSCP model showed better continuity and compactness than previous methods. The number of selected blocks of the SSCP model was positively correlated with the proportion of species protection and the weight of compactness, indicating an increase of the proportion of species protection or an increase of the weight of density, would come up with an increase of the number of selected blocks. 【Conclusion】The mathematical programming model for new type of protected area, i.e. the SSCP model, was studied. The rationality of the algorithm was verified by a case study of the Daiyunshan Nature Reserve. Following proposal was provided: The Daiyunshan Nature Reserve should be extended towards northwest and southeast, with an extension of 6 km towards the northwest and an horizontal extension of 18 km; an extension of 9 km towards the southeast and a horizontal extension of 8 km. The proposed method presents a new idea for the theory and practice of planning and design of protected areas in China. © 2018, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

While SCP has traditionally attempted to conserve ecosystem services that benefit ecological systems, public perceptions of conservation initiatives influence their ultimate feasibility and sustainability. In an attempt to balance ecological integrity, social utility, and urban development, this study develops a framework that applies four popular models to represent these competing factors, including two ecosystem services models-InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs) for biophysical services (BpS), and SolVES (Social Values for Ecosystem Services) for social values (SV); a land use and land cover (LULC) suitability model; and Zonation for delimiting high priority areas. We also analyze a number of conservation scenarios that consider varying levels of urban development. While BpS are distributed with considerable spatial variability, SV spatially overlap. Approximately 6% of the area was identified as having both high BpS and SV, whereas a further 24.5% of the area was identified as either high BpS low SV or vise-versa. Urban development scenarios affected the conservation area selection drastically. These results indicate tradeoffs and potential synergies between development, SV, and BpS. Our findings suggest that the information provided by the proposed framework can assist in finding solutions to social-ecological planning complexities that serve multiple stakeholders. © 2017 by the authors.","Biophysical services (BpS); Conservation strategy; Ecosystem services; Social values; Social values (SV); Social-ecological matrix; Systematic conservation planning (SCP)","China; biophysics; conservation planning; ecosystem service; land cover; land use; prioritization; protected area; social policy; strategic approach; watershed","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019066309"

This paper moves this research further by exploring how diverse forms of power play a crucial role in shaping these spatial dimensions and the production of social–ecological outcomes. Grounding these explorations in a National Protected Area in Lao PDR, this paper explores how power relationships operate through the spatial and temporal domains of complex systems. Findings suggest (at least) four important insights: (1) the exercise of power materializes in policies and programs and becomes written onto the spaces of social–ecological systems through boundary creation, zonation, and other social processes that (re)define spatial meanings; these meanings vary by social actor; (2) policies and programs map out unevenly across space and time as they interact with antecedent social–ecological conditions in ways that preclude linear causal relationships between policy and outcomes; (3) although local in their expression, spatialized disputes in social–ecological systems draw on cross-scalar discourses and networks of power to bolster, undermine, and (de)legitimize competing environmental and social narratives; and (4) however powerful institutions and actor-networks may be, they are never fully hegemonic as they are attenuated by other discourses and operations of power, although these all play out across a highly uneven sociopolitical terrain. Paying greater attention to the spatial and temporal dynamics of power may be much more than a project of introducing yet another variable into the already complex admixture of analytic elements. Rather, by rendering these explicit as objects of analysis, common insights may change entirely or even be overturned. © 2017 by the author(s).","Conflict; Ecological systems; Governance; Lao PDR; Protected area; Social; Spatial resiliences","Laos; actor network theory; conflict management; governance approach; policy approach; power relations; protected area","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030567950"

It is significant to study the priority protection area of species to develop dynamic strategies for biodiversity conservation under climate change scenarios. In the current study, we estimated the potential distribution of five species (Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus), moose (Alces alces), otter (Lutra lutra), sable (Martes zibellina), and black-billed capercaillie (Tetrao parvirostris)) in Northeast China over time using Maxent. We used nine general circulation models (GCMs), and four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) to derive future climate projections over three time periods (2030, 2050, 2070), and then modeled species distributions using these predicted environmental measurements for each time period. Zonation was combined with the results from Maxent to identify priority areas, which were further used to optimize the current nature reserve systems. According to the evaluation results of nine GCMs, appropriate climate models in Northeast China were obtained. Based on the GAP analysis for these conservation priority areas, proposals for priority conservation plans were made. The results showed that climate change in the study area would cause a considerable decline in the total distribution areas of the five species. However, different projections by GCMs may cause uncertainty of the predicted distributions. By comparing the species potential distributions, these four GCMs (CCSM4, NorESM1-M, HadGEM2-AO, and GFDL-CM3) performed well in Northeast China. The mean percentage of species potential range loss increased, as 62. 16% range loss by 2030; -73.93% by 2050; and -78.46% by 2070.

In previous studies, it has been shown that the distance to hydrothermal fluids is also a major structuring factor. Imagery analysis based on two dimensional photo stitching revealed insights to the vent field zonation around fluid exits and a basic knowledge of faunal assemblages within hydrothermal vent fields. However, complex three dimensional surfaces could not be adequately replicated in those studies, and the assemblage structure, as well as their relation to abiotic terrain variables, is often only descriptive. In this study we use ROV video imagery of a hydrothermal vent field on the southeastern Indian Ridge in the Indian Ocean. Structure from Motion photogrammetry was applied to build a high resolution 3D reconstruction model of one side of a newly discovered active hydrothermal chimney complex, allowing for the quantification of abundances. Likewise, the reconstruction was used to infer terrain variables at a scale important for megabenthic specimens, which were related to the abundances of the faunal assemblages. Based on the terrain variables, applied random forest model predicted the faunal assemblage distribution with an accuracy of 84.97 %. The most important structuring variables were the distances to diffuse- and black fluid exits, as well as the height of the chimney complex. This novel approach enabled us to classify quantified abundances of megabenthic taxa to distinct faunal assemblages and relate terrain variables to their distribution. The successful prediction of faunal assemblage occurrences further supports the importance of abiotic terrain variables as key structuring factors in hydrothermal systems and offers the possibility to detect suitable areas for Marine Protected areas on larger spatial scales. This technique works for any kind of video imagery, regardless of its initial purpose and can be implemented in marine monitoring and management. © 2019 Gerdes, Martínez Arbizu, Schwarz-Schampera, Schwentner and Kihara.","3D reconstruction; Faunal assemblages; Hydrothermal vents; Random forest; Spatial distribution; Terrain variables","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065407126"

The benthic fauna of this region accounts for more than 1600 species showing marked latitudinal biogeographic differences characterizing this as one of the most important hotspot of biodiversity of cold-temperate environments. Despite numerous studies have been conducted to depict the biological characteristics of the fjords, the present situation is strongly unbalanced towards specific taxa. Hence, this study takes into consideration a community approach, highlighting the distribution of six benthic assemblages thriving on vertical walls along the Seno Magdalena fjord (Aysen region). Underwater pictures were used to characterize the trends in abundance and diversity of the main taxa showing distinct responses to salinity and turbidity. Among the less tolerant taxa to high fresh water inputs there are encrusting algae, mainly found in the most external sites lashed by outer currents, far from the estuarine plume.

We used hierarchical Bayesian multispecies mixture models and MaxEnt models to describe species’ distributions and the program Zonation to identify areas of conservation priority for each aquatic group. The landscape-scale factors that best characterized aquatic species’ distributions differed among groups. There was low agreement and congruence among taxa-specific conservation priorities (<20%), meaning no surrogate priority areas would include or protect the best habitats of other aquatic taxa.

In tropical areas, wild palms are highly valued keystone resources with growing demand for both subsistence uses and commercial trade. Here we focused on eight such species (Borassus aethiopum Mart., Eremospathamacrocarpa (G.Mann & H.Wendl.) H.Wendl., Hyphaene thebaica Mart., Laccosperma opacum (G.Mann & H.Wendl.) Drude, Phoenix reclinata Jacq., Raphia hookeri G.Mann & H.Wendl., Raphia sudanica A. Chev., and Raphia vinifera P.Beauv.). This study tested (i) how those palms distributions may be affected under future climate scenarios, and (ii) if species are effectively conserved currently and under future forecasts for their native distributional areas. Finally, we defined spatial priorities for the species’ conservation. Available bioclimatic and soil data layers were used for the modelling with maximum entropy approaches, and resulting maps were overlaid on the existing protected areas network. Results showed that much of the distribution of the species will remain largely stable, albeit with some expansion and retraction in some species; relationships with protected areas networks suggest that protected portions of species distributions will also remain stable. The areas identified as highest conservation priority differ between models even though the highest-priority areas holding most palm species are located along the coast (from Guinea to Nigeria). Further development of these analyses could aid in forming a more complete picture of the distributions and populations of the species, which in turn could aid in developing effective conservation strategies for this botanically important family. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biodiversity; Ecological niche; GIS; Representative concentration pathways; Zonation","West Africa; Borassus aethiopum; Hyphaene thebaica; Laccosperma opacum; Phoenix reclinata; Raphia hookeri; Raphia sudanica; Raphia vinifera; bioclimatology; biodiversity; climate conditions; ecological zonation; evergreen tree; future prospect; GIS; keystone species; niche; prioritization; protected area; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; species conservation; sustainable development; wild population","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965050406"

Using high-resolution range maps of exceptional quality, we also assess the representation of fish taxa within the state's protected areas and examine the concordance of high-priority catchments with existing reserves and among distinct taxonomic groups. Although most of the state's native fishes are found within protected areas, only a small proportion of their ranges are represented. Few high-priority catchments occur within protected areas, suggesting that fish conservation will require active management and targeted river restoration outside of reserves.

In this study, time-series remotely-sensed data (1993-2006-2012) were used to monitor vegetation transformation in the Kruger to Canyons Biosphere Reserve (K2C) of South Africa, updating previous land-cover research. We identified changes in spatial extent, rate and intensity of land-cover change and extrapolated observed trends to 2018. The increased rate of change in the recent observation period (2.3 vs. 5.7%) was driven by more intensive gains in impacted vegetation and settlement since 2006 (>210 km2 and >120 km2), with resultant transformation of intact habitat undermining regional connectivity. By 2012, intact vegetation had suffered losses of 6.3% (>350 km2) since 2006 and >14% (>750 km2) since 1993. A further 9.5% loss of intact habitat may represent a critical threshold, establishing K2C above the 50% threshold of landscape transformation, whereafter a rapid decline in landscape resilience is likely. Given the BR's spatial zonation, such a loss across the full extent of K2C is unlikely, at least in the short-term (i.e., by 2018). Yet, based on past trends of transformation in the unprotected transition zone, anticipating such losses in the longer term, is not unfounded (i.e., 2024). © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2016.","Intensity Analysis; Kruger to Canyons Biosphere Reserve; Man and the Biosphere Programme; natural resource management; protected area; socio-ecological system","Kruger to Canyons Biosphere; Biospherics; Decision making; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Metadata; Natural resources management; Vegetation; Biosphere reserve; Intensity analysis; Man and the Biosphere Programme; Natural resource management; Protected areas; Socio-ecological systems; connectivity; decision making; land cover; landscape change; natural resource; protected area; remote sensing; research program; resource management; threshold; time series analysis; UNESCO; vegetation dynamics; Conservation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969670152"

We used field-collected and museum specimens combined with high-resolution environmental variables to identify common distributional patterns, estimate the suitable habitat for each species, and develop a conservation proposal related to the Protected Natural Areas (PNAs) system. Distributional models diverged into two opposite patterns: suitable habitats for most species at relatively high altitude in the hills, and suitable habitats for Bothrops ammodytoides and Lygophis anomalus at relatively low altitude in the surrounding hill plain. We assessed two proposals based on different conservation algorithms: the additive benefit function (ABF), which favours hilly environments, prioritizing areas with high specific richness, and the core-area zonation (CAZ), which prioritizes the distribution of all species, further indicating areas with low richness in the surrounding plain. Regardless of the algorithm used, our results indicated that the existing PNAs are not effective in protecting the snake assemblage. Protecting at least 5% of the highest species richness areas (ABF) or 5% of the distribution core areas of all species (CAZ), the existing PNAs only represented 2.2% of these priority areas. Our findings are largely consistent with previous work, highlighting that a widespread area needs to be assigned for conservation purposes. Thus, protection of the snake assemblage should take place both inside and outside the PNAs. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Conservation; Protected natural areas; Snake assemblages; Suitable habitat","Argentina; Sierras de Ventania; South America; Bothrops ammodytoides; conservation management; endemism; habitat selection; protected area; snake; spatial distribution; species richness; temperate environment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051663629"

This paper identifies biogeographical patterns of multiple taxa in the Netherlands, where no endemics are present at species level, on the basis of characteristic species. We used occurrence data on five species groups in order to identify spatially coherent, ecologically important regions. TWINSPAN was used to cluster grid squares according to similarity in species composition for each taxonomic group. Species that are characteristic of each of the clusters were identified using a preference index, and corresponding clusters among the taxonomic groups were identified with Kappa statistics. Regions containing characteristic species for several taxonomic groups were defined as 'hotspots'. Stepwise discriminant analysis was then used to characterize these hotspots according to differences in environmental conditions. The analysis yielded five regions that are clearly distinct in terms of species composition for individual taxonomic groups. Each region is characterized by a set of unique species that occur in the zonation of at least two of the taxonomic groups. Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed significant environmental differences among these regions. The concept of hotspots as operationalized in this study can make nature conservation planning more efficient. In combination, the hotspots defined here comprise the majority of the species occurring in the Netherlands for the studied groups. Therefore, this regionalization should be taken into account when prioritizing nature conservation efforts. © 2010 The Author(s).","Biodiversity; Biodiversity conservation; Characteristic species; Conservation biogeography; Hotspots of characteristic species; Multiple taxa; The Netherlands","Netherlands; biodiversity; biogeography; cluster analysis; conservation planning; habitat conservation; prioritization; protected area; species conservation; taxonomy; TWINSPAN","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954457825"

We focused on Borneo, where many remaining areas of tropical forest are highly fragmented, and we assessed the extent to which Protected Areas (PAs) protect highly-connected forest sites. We analysed remotely-sensed land cover data (0. 86 km2 grid cell resolution) using 'Zonation' reserve design software, and we ranked grid cells (rank 0-1) according to forest extent and connectivity. PAs currently cover 9% of Borneo, but <20% of highly-connected cells (i. e. cells with Zonation ranks ≥0. 9) lie within PAs. Approximately 65% of highly-connected cells were located above 400 m elevation, although >60% of Borneo's total land area lies below 200 m and only 15% of highly-connected cells occurred in these low elevation areas. These findings were relatively insensitive to assumptions about species' dispersal ability (within the range 1-20 km; representing relatively mobile animal species). The percentage of highly-connected grid cells within PAs could rise from <20 to >50% under proposed new PAs (including the 'Heart of Borneo' project), although many other highly-connected sites will remain unprotected. On-going land-use changes mean that existing PAs in lowland areas are likely to become increasingly isolated within inhospitable agricultural landscapes, and improving connectivity through reforestation and rehabilitation of degraded forest may be required to maintain the conservation value of these PAs in future. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change adaptation; Landscape permeability; Landscape prioritization; Reserve design; SE Asia","Borneo; Animalia; assessment method; climate change; data set; dispersal; forest ecosystem; habitat fragmentation; habitat restoration; habitat type; land cover; land use change; landscape; protected area; reforestation; remote sensing; resolution; software; tropical forest","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80054028442"

Location: Cerrado Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil. Methods: We built ecological niche models (ENMs) for 154 mammals inhabiting the cerrado. We combined model projections to produce consensus maps of species' distributions for three types of models (envelope, statistical and machine-learning models). We used these range summaries as input data in spatial prioritization analyses. We compared six conservation scenarios, considering human population density, land cost, anthropogenic land use, political willingness to act and the distribution of species using trade-off analyses. We complemented the current network of protected areas, aiming to achieve a target of 17% of land protection in the cerrado. Results: Species-rich sites coincide with regions with high human population, high land cost, high anthropogenic land use and diverse levels of political willingness to act. We found a significant change in spatial priorities when we included socioeconomic and political dimensions in analyses: top-priority sites moved north, reduced by 68% potential conservation conflicts with human population, reduced by 72% the total monetary cost of actions and reduced by 68% conflict with other anthropogenic land uses. It also increased by 80% the beneficial effect of political willingness to act. Main conclusions: Our results reinforce the idea that using only biological criteria for proposing spatial conservation priorities can undermine conservation plans given increases in socioeconomic and political conflicts. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Conservation conflict; Conservation planning; Mammals; Multi-criterion analysis; Spatial prioritization; Zonation","Brazil; Mammalia; biodiversity; cerrado; conservation planning; cost-benefit analysis; ecological modeling; land use change; mammal; multicriteria analysis; niche; political conflict; population density; prioritization; socioeconomic conditions; species conservation; trade-off; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84880136409"

We compared the extent of forested, nonforested, and fragmented areas between lowland (<1000 masl) and montane zones of the Blue Mountains inside the Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park established in Jamaica in 1993. We found that in 2008, inside the montane zone, only 4 percent of forest was cleared, and forest fragmentation was minimal. In the lowland zone, however, the percentage of forest cleared was seven times as high, and the density of fragments was 11-fold higher. We established twenty-five 0.04ha lowland plots; ordination of tree species composition in these plots reflected a rainfall gradient, showing that plots on the wetter northern side of the Blue Mountains were floristically different from those on the drier southern side. The conservation value of the remaining lowland forest is high because of its high endemism (18% of species in our plots) and beta diversity. In addition, IUCN Red List data show that about 71 percent of threatened tree species in the Blue Mountains grow in the lowland region, 92 percent of which are endemic. From these findings, we identify a 'protected area hotspot zone', which lies between the PA boundary and the core high-altitude zone, and which should be instituted in IUCN categories I and II PAs. © 2010 The Author(s).

Integrating biodiversity conservation and the development of local communities is a major challenge for biosphere reserves. Their zonation (core, buffer and transition) is intended to promote biodiversity conservation and sustainable development, although only the core zone is legally constituted to conserve biological diversity. Inevitably, and especially in developing countries, the management of biosphere reserves has to reconcile trade-offs between conservation and development, and address the pressures placed by local communities on the biodiversity resources of the reserve. 2. We studied the effects of development in the three zones of Yancheng Biosphere Reserve (eastern China) on the endangered red-crowned crane Grus japonensis, the waterbird communities and the economic benefits to local communities. We tested the hypothesis that allowing different developments within each zone can reduce conflict between biodiversity conservation and community development. 3. The number of cranes in the reserve increased from 361 to approximately 1100 between 1982 and 1999, but declined markedly to 612 in 2003. The cranes also became increasingly concentrated in the core zone and switched to feeding predominantly in artificial habitats. The proportion of cranes in the core, buffer and transition zones was largely associated with the proportion of developed land area and the total number of cranes in the reserve as a whole. 4. Developments in the transition zone have reduced and degraded the wetlands, and have disadvantaged cranes and waterbirds. In contrast, the transformation of natural wetlands into artificial ones in the core zone has, to date, continued to support cranes and waterbirds. This has brought economic benefits to the reserve and local communities, but at the cost of the integrity of the wetland ecosystem as a whole. 5. Synthesis and applications. Despite an increase in the number of red-crowned cranes in Yancheng Biosphere Reserve, their range has collapsed into the core of the reserve where there is now a substantial artificial wetland complex. Allowing development in all three zones, together with a lack of resources for conservation, appears to have contributed to the reserve becoming overdeveloped. The loss of ecosystem integrity across the reserve as a whole highlights the need for an ecosystem-based approach to future management combined with the restoration of natural wetlands. © 2008 British Ecological Society.","China; Coastal wetlands; Ecosystem-based conservation; Grus japonensis; Protected area; Red-crowned crane; Waterbirds; Yancheng Biosphere Reserve; Zonation management","Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Jiangsu; Yancheng Biosphere Reserve; Balearica pavonina; Gruidae; Grus japonensis; biodiversity; biosphere; coastal wetland; hypothesis testing; nature conservation; nature reserve; sustainable development; transition zone; waterfowl; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-65349126040"

This study is aimed at assisting national and international stakeholders in strengthening the Ibis Protected Area, established in 2004 and still lacking a clear boundary and management zonation, by quantitatively establishing the range used by these birds through use of satellite tracking and field observations collected between 2006 and 2009. The core breeding range used by the ibises is 224-253 km2 while the full home range is c.1,500 km2, encompassing a mountainous area north of Palmyra, ranging from 400 to 1,000 m asl. Locations from satellite tracking also revealed an important unknown post-breeding site. The ibis breeding area is also home to a range of other rare and endangered fauna as well as significant landscape, cultural and recreational assets, establishing it as an area of international importance. The Syrian steppe is a crucial socio-economic asset for the country, not only for the indigenous pastoralist people, but also because Syria seeks to develop and promote ecotourism in the Palmyra region. The steppe is increasingly suffering from damaging desertification. The need for investment in protection and management of key biodiversity and landscape assets is a precondition that needs greater recognition by the authorities.

Important Plant Areas are defined as the most important places in the world for wild plant diversity and need to be identified according to common criteria. The main methodological challenges are the lack of recent, easily accessible data for species and habitats and the definition of practical boundaries. The Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC-CBD) aims to protect 50% of the most important areas for plant diversity and to conserve in situ 60% of the threatened species by 2010. To measure the extent to which the GSPC targets were fulfilled, we assessed the level of protection afforded to the IPAs and species. We identified 351 top ranking cells, which yielded a total of 312. IPAs, covering approximately 15% of Italy. More than 80% of the IPAs currently have some form of legal protection and over 60% of the selected species are included in the existing protected areas. The method we are proposing may be used where no systematic data collection program exists. The transition from grids to polygons is an "" expert-based passage"" that exploits different sources of information, such as species point locality data, vegetation maps and expert-based indications.

We examine these methodological issues in the use of reserve selection algorithms by comparing: (1) quality of input data and (2) use of different weighting methods for prioritizing among species. In 2003, the government of Madagascar, a global biodiversity hotspot, committed to tripling the size of its protected area network to protect 10% of the country's total land area. We apply the Zonation reserve selection algorithm to distribution data for 52 lemur species to identify priority areas for the expansion of Madagascar's reserve network. We assess the similarity of the areas selected, as well as the proportions of lemur ranges protected in the resulting areas when different forms of input data were used: extent of occurrence versus refined extent of occurrence. Low overlap between the areas selected suggests that refined extent of occurrence data are highly desirable, and to best protect lemur species, we recommend refining extent of occurrence ranges using habitat and altitude limitations. Reserve areas were also selected for protection based on three different species weighting schemes, resulting in marked variation in proportional representation of species among the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species extinction risk categories. This result demonstrates that assignment of species weights influences whether a reserve network prioritizes maximizing overall species protection or maximizing protection of the most threatened species. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a recent Forest Accord for Northwest Ontario has almost doubled the areas reserved for parks and conservation reserves creating a dilemma where increased wood production will be needed from decreased areas of forest land available primarily for timber management. This dilemma can be partially resolved using intensive management for forest plantations established on productive (good site) forest lands. Intensively managed plantations have the potential for producing greatly increased quantity and quality of wood, thus partially resolving present and future wood supply needs. Concentrating wood production on selected good sites in Northwest Ontario also will allow us to dedicate increased areas of forest land to multiple-use management as well as more parks and conservation reserves.","Forest land zonation; Site-quality evaluation tools; Site-specific silviculture; Stand and landscape diversity","Forest Management; Forest Products; Ontario; Plantations; Canada; North America; Ontario [Canada]; Oregon; United States; Washington [United States]; Canada; Conservation; Timber; Wood products; Forest land zonation; Landscape diversity; Site quality evaluation tools; Site specific silviculture; forest management; forestry production; land use; protected area; silviculture; timber market; tree planting; wood quality; Forestry","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-35548989334"

Data on resident forest birds were collected during ten-minute sampling periods at points along altitudinal gradients, in primary and modified forests and in rainforests on different geology. While all species ever reported from Halmahera have been recorded down to near sea level, many of the forest birds of Buru, including a number of restricted-range and endemic species, are largely confined to montane forest, and only common above 800-900 maltitude. The existence of a distinct montane bird community on Buru, but not on Halmahera, is attributed to the relatively large, continuous area of forest at high altitude on this island. Forest on Halmahera at such altitudes is limited and fragmented. While most species survive in modified forests, some were significantly rarer in this habitat and may depend on adjacent areas of primary forest. Mangroves supported impoverished forest bird communities, typically of more adaptable species. On Halmahera, rainforest on ultrabasic rock appears to be impoverished when compared with rainforest on other rock formations, in particular supporting very low numbers of two species of threatened parrot.

This includes the Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Tanzania, and the Seychelles. Three generations or categories of MPAs are distinguished: i) small areas for protection of a single species or unique marine habitat; ii) large multiple use MPAs designed for coastal development as well as biodiversity protection; and iii) MPAs managed by a nongovernmental organization (NGO) or the private sector. Each of these MPA types is examined according to the policies, legislation, and management systems they entail as well as the economic and community situation they operate within. The paper also provides a review of some eastern African MPAs in terms of their size and location, the type of MPA, zonation schemes, and financial status. The successes of the different types of MPAs are discussed based on specific indicators, such as changes in biodiversity, infrastructure, compliance to regulations and the level of involvement of primary stakeholders in the management. From the review it is clear that a fourth generation of MPAs may be forthcoming; community-based MPAs. Although lack of data makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of these different categories of MPAs, it is clear that no MPA can succeed without support of the local communities. Generally, the results of the analysis are promising for MPAs, however a lack of data is hampering a deeper analysis. The major issues facing MPAs in the region are highlighted, as well as some regional initiatives striving to address these issues.

From knowledge of the eco-ethology of arthropods that live in this environment, an attempt was made to assess the spatial and temporal strategies of the red fox. A total of 525 faeces were analysed. Monthly samplings were made along two transects for an entire year. At the same time, standard trapping methods were used to collect arthropods that could represent fox's possible prey. During winter remains of plants and vertebrates were the main categories found in the faeces, whereas in the other seasons invertebrates, and in particular Coleoptera, principally occurred in the faeces. Taxa belonging to other environments and items scavenged from waste ground were not found. Through the zonation and activity patterns of the most abundant invertebrate categories, a seasonal change in the fox's foraging strategy was assessed. Foxes were active in different zones and hours of the day, according to the season, preying on large invertebrates during their period of surface activity (diurnal-nocturnal) or smelling them under beach debris (diurnal and seasonal resting sites). The results confirm the great behavioural plasticity of the fox which prefers to exploit food resources found in an undisturbed environment, modulating its feeding both in space and in time, rather than searching for food outside the protected area.","Arthropods; Faecal analysis; Feeding strategy; Mediterranean beach-dune system; Vulpes vulpes","arthropod; beach; bioindicator; dune; foraging; Italy; red fox; Burano; Italy; Tuscany; Coleoptera; Vulpes vulpes; arthropod; bioindicator; diet; faecal analysis; foraging activity; red fox","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032033803"

TWINSPAN analysis defines more or less geographically coherent regions comprising groups arranged in E-W bands. The avifaunal zonations echo a steep climatic gradient from the seasonally wet tropics in the N to arid C Australia. Positions of individual cells on the primary axis of a DCA ordination are most strongly correlated with rainfall in the wettest quarter and are precisely predicted (r2=0.94) from a combination of climatic and vegetation structure variables. The close correlation of climate variables with avian species composition is interpreted to reflect the generally unmodified condition of most of the Northern Territory landscape. This long and relatively intact biological gradient offers unique opportunities to design a conservation reserve system that preserves representative samples of all major ecosystems; assess the impacts of climate change on biota under a broad range of conditons; and arrange protected areas along the gradient to maintain biological diversity in the face of adverse climate change. -from Authors","","Australia; Northern Territory; Aves; cellular organisms; Galliformes; avifauna; conservation; zoogeography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027039107"

Views were sought about the main objectives of marine protection, ideal zonation of MPAs and the ways to manage stakeholders' competing interests in MPAs. There was good agreement on the objectives of marine protection; conservation and fisheries management scored highly, while research, education and tourism had lower scores. However, there was disagreement on which objective was most important, with most stakeholders listing conservation, while fishers listed fisheries management. Most stakeholders considered MPAs that had been established for longer periods of time to offer more conservation than fisheries benefits. Analysis of the perceptions shows strong preference for having MPAs with different use zonations, including designated areas for recreational fishing, diving and the full protection of species and ecosystems. The results point to a need for increased dialogue between scientists, managers and fishers to improve the disparity in understanding the fisheries benefits of marine protection between these groups. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Fuel hazard issues in the ROW are due largely to historic reliance on hand slashing in some areas. These fuels are cause for concern, particularly in terms of BC Transmission Corporation's degree of responsibility for damage caused by fire spreading from the ROW into adjacent areas. Until now, BCTC has lacked a systematic method for prioritization of fuel hazard mitigation treatments. It is intended that the development of the Wildfire Risk Management System provides: a foundation for the development of a risk management zonation strategy; a framework on which to assess and prioritize fuel hazards; and promote the development of new guidelines for vegetation management on the ROW. In simple terms, one wants to know at any given location and at any given time, what is the probability of wildfire occurring, and what are the potential consequences (for a given wildfire behavior) on valued resources. This enables fire and resource managers to design strategies and tactics for fire management that vary from high probability-low consequence to low probability-high consequence fire risks across the ROW. The generic approach underlying the WRMS allows its application in a wide range of fire management planning circumstances from timber supply areas to protected areas and interface communities. © 2008 Copyright © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

At this latitude, considered high and marginal for coral distribution and development, they form a veneer on limited, late Pleistocene reefs rather than forming the accretive, aragonite structures known as coral reefs. It is thus more appropriate to refer to them in this region as coral communities, the environment being rendered marginal for their development by reduced temperatures, light and aragonite saturation state. Subsequent to their discovery, the reefs were afforded protection within two Marine Protected Areas (the St Lucia and Maputaland Marine Reserves). They are found primarily within three reef complexes, with only the central complex being readily accessible to the public for ecotourism at present. With the creation of the Greater St Lucia Wetland Park, a World Heritage Site, and the expectation of an accompanying increase in ecotourism, the status quo seems set to change. The reefs are thus the current focus of a modelling initiative to provide decision support in their management. This paper examines the unique nature of the South African communities, their vulnerability and importance in the regional and global context, and, using representative data from the model, how an anticipated increase in their use could affect their sustainability.

Cultivation, landscape position, slope and sampling depth were all significantly (P < 0.05) related to variation in SOC stocks following forest conversion but time since conversion had no detectable impact.

Combining the proposed management category system and function zonation system together will allow developing specific management objectives for each different management categories and different function zones, and therefore it would provide flexible options for management of protected areas with multiple functions. This system would also allow establishing a set of management standards to regulate protected areas' management practices, and provide evaluation criteria for supervision. In the end, the paper also described the advantages of the integrative system of management categories and the function zones compared with IUCN's management category system of protected areas, and how the system can address some key problems existing in the management of protected areas.","Function zone; IUCN; Management category; Management objective; Protected area","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856697994"

The biota of the ecosystem respond to the physical environment, and because of this much of the management of the system has been focused on the management of water and sediments. Much of the management has been initiated as a response to flood and drought events and then tempered by public perceptions on how the system should be managed. As an historical account, it is necessary to identify the driving events, to describe the scientific understanding at the time, to mention the public pressures on the managers and to identify those individual people who have been the main drivers of the management interventions. This review focuses on the management of water and sediments, but there have also been other management actions which are not discussed in this chapter. These include the management of the fisheries and the controlled harvesting of its other natural resources, the zonation of the estuarine system for public use, the provision of recreational facilities, the maintenance of the integrity of the protected area and the prevention of poaching.Many of the records available are unpublished documents; records of meetings, unpublished reports detailing scientific investigations and the plans and records of work being done.

In Italy, recent assessments have highlighted the insufficient state of conservation of these habitats as defined by the EU Habitats Directive. The effects of predicted climate change could have dramatic consequences for coastal environments in the near future. An assessment of the efficacy of protection measures under climate change is thus a priority. Here, we have developed environmental envelope models for the most widespread dune habitats in Italy, following two complementary approaches: an ""indirect"" plant-species-based one and a simple ""direct"" one. We analyzed how habitats distribution will be altered under the effects of two climate change scenarios and evaluated if the current Italian network of protected areas will be effective in the future after distribution shifts. While modeling dune habitats with the ""direct"" approach was unsatisfactory, ""indirect"" models had a good predictive performance, highlighting the importance of using species' responses to climate change for modeling these habitats. The results showed that habitats closer to the sea may even increase their geographical distribution in the near future. The transition dune habitat is projected to remain stable, although mobile and fixed dune habitats are projected to lose most of their actual geographical distribution, the latter being more sensitive to climate change effects. Gap analysis highlighted that the habitats' distribution is currently adequately covered by protected areas, achieving the conservation target. However, according to predictions, protection level for mobile and fixed dune habitats is predicted to drop drastically under the climate change scenarios which we examined. Our results provide useful insights for setting management priorities and better addressing conservation efforts to preserve these threatened habitats in future. © 2013 Prisco et al.","","Biodiversity; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Italy; Models, Theoretical; Plants; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; article; climate change; coastal dune; ecosystem; geographic distribution; habitat; Italy; nonhuman; plant; prediction; sea; species conservation; species distribution; species identification; zonation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879939208"

Bats [Order Chiroptera) comprise more than 42% (82 species) of this diversity. Analyses of bat capture records over a transect extending more than 3 km in elevation show that most bat species at Manu are widely distributed in the Amazon Basin. Few are montane endemics or are localized in south-eastern Peru, although exceptions to this generalization include two species new to science. Highland bat faunas tend to be attenuated versions of those found below, and the elevational zonation of bat communities is weak. Species turnover with elevation is monotonic and more-or-less smooth, with Jaccard's similarity values falling to 0.5 for sites differing by 750m in elevation. Subtle and orderly change in species composition with elevation is also reflected in the nested-subset structure of these communities; over 19 different levels, this pattern of hierarchical structure is both striking and highly significant. Elevational ranges of species generally increase with elevation, in accordance with Stevens' extension of 'Rapoport's rule' of range amplitude. However, support for 'Stevens' rule' may be trivial, given Amazonian richness and Andean impoverishment. Reduced richness and poorly developed endemism in Andean bat communities contrast with patterns shown by sympatric rodent faunas, which are diverse and strongly endemic on the Altiplano and markedly zoned along the Eastern Versant.

Location: The study was carried out in two nearby semi-arid protected areas of the Ispahan province: the Kolah-Ghazi National Park (c. 50,000 ha; 1540-2535 m a.s.l.) and the Mouteh Wildlife Refuge (c. 220,000 ha; 1493-2900 m a.s.l.). Annual average precipitation and temperature range from 155-205 mm and 15-19.5°C, respectively. Vegetation cover is sparse. Methods: The two study areas were sampled with a 1 × 1 km grid design. A subset of 405 squares was randomly chosen and each was visited once during spring or summer by a team of five observers walking from one side of a square to the other and back, recording the birds encountered. Raptors and species considered to be accidental or migrating were not taken into account. We first looked for avifaunal, vegetation, and geomorphological gradients using Correspondence Analysis. As we found spatial autocorrelation within our response variables (avifaunal richness, abundance and/or composition), we first calculated an autocorrelation term, then added this autocorrelation term in anova, ancova (separate slope design) and stepwise regression to assess the relative role of spatial autocorrelation and environmental explanatory variables (vegetation, altitude, climate, or topography). We also partitioned the variance of the avifaunal matrix between several sets of co-variables, after controlling for spatial effects, using a series of partial Canonical Correspondence Analyses. Results: A main gradient, common to the two areas, distinguishes bird species characteristic of flat sedimentary areas and species dwelling in mountainous and/or rocky areas. Despite the generally low values of the correlations measured, we found that richness, abundance and composition of the avifauna were better correlated with topography, especially the altitudinal amplitude within each square, than any other variable, including vegetation. Altitudinal amplitude is related to substrate complexity. Main conclusions: In arid zones of central Iran, topographic features seem to be the main factors structuring avifaunal composition and abundance. Avifaunal composition and richness are mainly correlated with the complexity of the substrate, but both avifaunal richness and abundance increase with altitude, probably in response to decreasing aridity. We did not observe any bird altitudinal zonation in a strict sense. These results contrast with those generally observed in mid-latitude regions of the Palaearctic. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Avifaunal community; Birds; Climate; Compositional gradient; Iran; Species abundance; Species richness; Sub-desert areas; Topography; vegetation","Asia; Eurasia; Iran; Middle East; Aves; Raptores; abundance; avifauna; community composition; species richness; topography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33645225750"

Typically, the Biosphere Reserve model is applied to an established landscape mosaic of existing land uses; these are often socio-ecological systems where strict environmental protection and community livelihoods are in conflict, and environmental degradation frequently accompanies ""use"". This raises challenges for successful implementation of the model, as the reality of the existing land-use mosaic undermines the theoretical aspirations of the Biosphere concept. This study focuses on the Kruger to Canyons Biosphere Reserve (K2C), South Africa; a socio-ecological landscape where formal conservation is juxtaposed against extensive impoverished rural communities. We focus on land-cover changes of the existing land-use mosaic (1993-2006), specifically selected land-cover classes identified as important for biodiversity conservation and local-level resource utilization. We discuss the implications of transformation for conservation, sustainable resource-use, and K2C's functioning as a ""Biosphere Reserve"". Spatially, changes radiated outward from the settlement expanse, with little regard for the theoretical land-use zonation of the Biosphere Reserve. Settlement growth tracked transport routes, transforming cohesive areas of communal-use rangelands. Given the interdependencies between the settlement population and local environmental resources, the Impacted Vegetation class expanded accordingly, fragmenting the Intact Vegetation class, and merging rangelands. This has serious implications for sustainability of communal harvesting areas, and further transformation of intact habitat. The distribution and magnitude of Intact Vegetation losses raise concerns around connectivity and edge effects, with long-term consequences for ecological integrity of remnant habitat, and K2C's existing network of protected areas. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Biodiversity conservation; Fragmentation; Kruger to Canyons Biosphere Reserve; Land-cover change; Landscape connectivity; Man and the Biosphere Programme","Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Rural Population; South Africa; South Africa; Biospherics; Conservation; Economics; Environmental protection; Land use; Sustainable development; Transportation routes; Biodiversity conservation; Biosphere reserve; Fragmentation; Land-cover change; Landscape connectivities; Man and the Biosphere Programme; biodiversity; conservation management; ecological modeling; environmental protection; habitat fragmentation; land cover; land use change; nature reserve; rangeland; resource use; sustainability; article; biodiversity; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; habitat; harvesting; land use; landscape; rangeland; resource allocation; rural population; socioeconomics; South Africa; vegetation dynamics; zonation; Ecosystems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84883451737"

The purpose of this study is to assess the degree of representation of Patagonian lizards in the existing protected area network, and to identify conservation priority areas that may help expand the current system. We obtained locality data for all Patagonian species from different sources and used them, together with environmental variables, to model their potential distribution. We then used a reserve-selection algorithm to assess the performance of the existing protected area network in representing all lizard species, and to identify new priority areas. Our results indicate that the existing protected areas fail to protect 10 of the 60 species modeled. To protect at least 5% of the geographic distribution of all species, the existing reserve network would need an additional 3.7% of the study area, whereas to protect at least 10% of the distribution of species, an extra 9.9% would be needed. We found eleven main priority areas needed to protect at least 5% or 10% of the distribution of all species of lizards. In conclusion, the current reserve network is not very effective at protecting the lizards of Patagonia, particularly those species with range-restricted distributions. We hope that this contribution will help direct conservation efforts in the region, by maximising the protection of biodiversity. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.","Priority areas; Reptiles; Species distribution models; Zonation","Patagonia; Reptilia; Squamata; biodiversity; endemism; geographical distribution; lizard; nature conservation; protected area; species conservation; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78651456838"

This shore receives considerable amounts of sediment during the spring break-up of the rivers. The sediments are stored on the steep narrow tidal flats and marshes, and in thinner (up to 80 cm) drapes on till-cored shoals that parallel and protect the coast. The low areas between the shoals and the mainland are swept and reworked by relatively powerful (2 m s-1) reversing currents due to flooding and ebbing of tides into the strait. A series of distinct environments and sedimentary facies develop on this western coast and its antecedent longshore shoal. The outer part of the shoal is characterized by tidal bedding, Macoma balthica burrows and considerable ice scour. The inner part of the shoal has winnowed sand, the greatest abundance of Macoma, and well-developed flaser bedding. The longshore tidal channel separating the shoal from the mainland has coarse sand lags in the shallower parts and silty sand in deeper protected areas. The steep tidal flats develop laminated silty sands locally saturated and slumping toward the channel. The high saturation of the sediments inhibits colonization of the flats by Macoma. The narrow marshes have characteristic vegetation zonation, with Puccinellia phryganodes colonizing the lower marsh. The sedimentary sequence of the marsh displays irregular, bioturbated laminated sequences of silt, silty sand and organic matter. © 1984.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021353061"

Yet, detailed knowledge of fish abundance is often reduced to a few sampled locations and a reliable prediction of this information across broader geographical areas is of major relevance. Generalised additive models (GAMs) were used to describe species- environment relationships and identify environmental parameters that determine the abundance or presence-absence of 11 reef fishes with contrasting life histories in shallow habitats of the Azores islands, Northeast Atlantic. Predictive models were mapped and visualised in a geographic information system (GIS) and areas with potential single or multi-species habitat hotspots were identified. Schooling, pelagic species typically required presence-absence models, whereas abundance models performed well for benthic species. Depth and distance to sediment significantly described the distribution for nearly all species, whereas the influence of exposure to swell or currents and slope of the seafloor depended on their trophic ecology. Potential presence of single species was widespread across the study area but much reduced for multiple species. There were no habitats shared by high abundances of all species in a given trophic group, and areas shared by minimal abundances were smaller than expected. Potential habitat hotspots should be considered as priority sites for conservation, but were only partially included in the existing MPA network. These findings highlight the potential of this methodology to support scientifically sound conservation planning, including but not restricted to fragmented and constrained habitats, such as those of oceanic archipelagos. © Inter-Research 2013.","Abundance; Azores; GAM; Generalised additive model; GIS; Habitat mapping; Multi-species; Spatial predictive modelling","Azores; Portugal; abundance; conservation planning; coral reef; GIS; habitat fragmentation; habitat management; hot spot; prediction; protected area; schooling behavior","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874068820"

Their design, however, often disregards both a thorough knowledge of the distribution of habitats and assemblages and the use of proper experimental evaluations of the efficacy of MPAs by comparing protected vs. unprotected zones. About 200 MPAs have been recently instituted in the Mediterranean area, but the evidence of their efficacy is scant. The MPA of Torre Guaceto (Southern Adriatic Sea, Italy) is one of the rare cases of effective protection enforcement. The reserve was instituted more than 10 years ago, a period currently considered as sufficient to show responses by organisms to protection. The MPA is divided into a C zone, the general reserve, where many activities are permitted, a B zone, the partial reserve where restrictions increase and two A zones, the integral reserve where access is prohibited. The goals of the paper were to map the distribution of benthic assemblages to assess if they were properly represented in the differently protected zones, and to test the efficacy of protection by quantifying possible differences between the assemblages in two control areas and in the two A zones, where human impact is completely excluded. The analysis of habitat and assemblage distribution within the MPA showed that the zones with total protection do not include most valuable environmental types. Most of the considered variables (i.e. cover of substratum, number of taxa, and average abundance of the most common taxa) were not significantly different in and out of the A zones, at each time of sampling. Results, however, suggested a possible effect of protection in modifying patterns of abundance of sponges under Cystoseira canopy (more abundant in the fully protected zone). In the subtidal habitat, differences were found in the structure of the whole assemblage and in the abundance of encrusting coralline red algae (more abundant outside the fully protected area). Notwithstanding the correct general methodology employed in the study, a lack of statistical power could have a role in preventing the detection of ecologically relevant effects of protection. In some instances, data pooling allowed a discrimination between cases where there was clearly no effect of protection and cases where there might be. On this basis, the optimization of this experimental design should be considered in further studies. In any case, if the goals of MPAs have not been clearly stated, efficacy of protection might prove very difficult to test even with the use of sound experimental designs. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The relationship of fish assemblages to environmental variation is poorly understood in many systems. In Chile zonation patterns of fish assemblages have been documented in several Andean river drainages. Coastal river drainages are comparatively small, but inordinately important because of their highly endemic flora and fauna and their proximity to major human populations. For conservation purposes it is important to understand what environmental factors affect assemblage structure of fishes especially in the comparatively high diversity coastal drainages. We studied patterns of fish distribution and abundance in three rivers of the coastal, Andalien drainage near Concepción, Chile. We used multi-dimensional scaling analyses to compare patterns among zones (rithron, transition and potamon) and high and low flow seasons. Species assemblages differed by zone, but not with season. Assemblages consisted of nested subsets of species characterized by their range of distribution among zones. One species group was composed of widespread species that occurred in all three zones, another species group consisted of species found only in transitional and potamal zones, and a final group was comprised of species found only in the potamal zone. The potamal zone contained the most diverse and abundant fish assemblage. Fish assemblages were related to both water quality and habitat structure variables. This study suggests that the key to conserving the diversity of native fish communities in coastal Chilean rivers is in the conservation of potamal regions. Unfortunately, most protected areas in Chile are in the depauperate headwaters of drainages. Protection of only headwaters is clearly inadequate and will not contribute to the conservation of this unique freshwater fish fauna. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Chile; Coastal drainage; Habitat structure; Water quality; Zonation","Chile; South America; Pisces; Potamon; abundance; coastal zone; community composition; environmental factor; environmental protection; fish; habitat structure; river system; spatial variation; species conservation; temporal variation; water quality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34548170959"

To fight the decline of biological diversity, conservation science has broken ground with methods such as the operational model of systematic conservation planning (SCP), which focuses on design and on-the-ground implementation of conservation areas. The most commonly used method in SCP is reserve selection that focuses on the spatial design of reserve networks and their expansion. We expanded these methods by introducing another form of spatial allocation of conservation effort relevant for land-use zoning at the landscape scale that avoids negative ecological effects of human land use outside protected areas. We call our method inverse spatial conservation prioritization. It can be used to identify areas suitable for economic development while simultaneously limiting total ecological and environmental effects of that development at the landscape level by identifying areas with highest economic but lowest ecological value. Our method is not based on a priori targets, and as such it is applicable to cases where the effects of land use on, for example, individual species or ecosystem types are relatively small and would not lead to violation of regional or national conservation targets. We applied our method to land-use allocation to peat mining. Our method identified a combination of profitable production areas that provides the needed area for peat production while retaining most of the landscape-level ecological value of the ecosystem.

We tested for spatial congruence between agricultural expansion in the 21st century and priority areas for carnivore conservation worldwide. We evaluated how including agricultural expansion data in conservation planning reduces such congruence and estimated the consequences of such an approach for the performance of resulting priority area networks. We investigated the correlation between projections of agricultural expansion and the solutions of global spatial prioritizations for carnivore conservation through the implementation of different goals: (1) purely maximizing species representation and (2) representing species while avoiding sites under high pressure for agriculture expansion. We also evaluated the performance of conservation solutions based on species' representation and their spatial congruence with established global prioritization schemes. Priority areas for carnivore conservation were spatially correlated with future agricultural distribution and were more similar to global conservation schemes with high vulnerability. Incorporating future agricultural expansion in the site selection process substantially reduced spatial correlation with agriculture, resulting in a spatial solution more similar to global conservation schemes with low vulnerability. Accounting for agricultural expansion resulted in a lower representation of species, as the average proportion of the range represented reduced from 58% to 32%. We propose that priorities for carnivore conservation could be integrated into a strategy that concentrates different conservation actions towards areas where they are likely to be more effective regarding agricultural expansion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Global biodiversity conservation priorities; IMAGE; Mammal conservation; Spatial prioritization; Zonation","agricultural practice; biogeography; carnivore; conservation planning; land use; mammal; nature conservation; prioritization; protected area; site selection; twenty first century; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881008329"

We also used logistic regression analyses to examine key environmental, socioeconomic and institutional drivers associated with deforestation. One of the areas, La Montaña (LM) at Hopelchen, Campeche, is part of the northern section and buffer zone of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (CBR) as well as part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. LM is an agricultural forest frontier region economically dependent on productive activities. The other study, Zona Maya (ZM), found at the municipality of Felipe Carrillo Puerto in Quintana is characterized by having developed community-based forestry enterprises with world wide recognition. In addition, the major tourism industry in nearby Cancun and Riviera Maya provide an important source of off-farm labor and temporary migration. Results show contrasting annual deforestation rates among the two study areas, being greater in the Campeche site (0.7% from 2000 to 2005) compared to Quintana Roo (-0.002% from 2000 to 2004). Logistic regression results show that the occurrence of land clearing at LM is significantly related to demographic variables as well as soil-environment types and conservation status did not reveal to relate to LUCC processes at all. At Quintana Roo, despite twice the population density, population variables at large did not strongly correlate to forest clearing. Rather forest conservation or maintenance was shown to be influenced by local community forestry institutions and a landscape zoning provided by larger management goals from the part of the communities. Greater availability of wage labor for the prominent tourism economy may also reflect a lesser dependence on agriculture and contribute to the much lower deforestation rate. Nonetheless, results show that community forest management can play an effective role in forest conservation. We argue for a regional land use management approach as a conservation strategy in which local inhabitants are considered key actors. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, some development trends on Changbai Mountain urgently require the launching of innovative policies and actions for sustainable forest conservation on Changbai Mountain. This paper provides an overview of forest conservation issues in the area: it summarizes the ecological significance of forest vegetation on Changbai Mountain, reviews historic forest utilization and protection in the region, and discusses forest conservation measures that exist on Changbai Mountain. The paper also describes specific civilization-based economic developments, including deforestation, logging, non-wood product collection, and tourism, which threaten forest sustainability inside and around protected areas on Changbai Mountain. We propose that forest ecosystem management should be implemented outside the designated protected areas and human pressure should be reduced inside nature reserves on Changbai Mountain. Landscape and ecosystem approaches should be used to promote forest conservation at the mountain level.

Species distribution models were developed from species' occurrence records using a maximum entropy algorithm. Maps of species distributions were produced for 15 of the 16 species currently present in the country. To assess the performance of the existing protected area network in representing all modeled species, and to identify priority areas to expand the current reserve system, we used the software Zonation. Overall, all species modeled are represented in the existing protected area network. However, the percentage of their ranges covered by protected areas is very low (average = 6.7%; range = 1.7-17.6%). To represent at least 5% of the distribution of each species, 8.8% of the country's area would be needed, and species with restricted ranges have the greatest increase in representation in this scenario. When 10% of the country is set aside for conservation, species representation increases considerably, again favoring range-restricted species. Most of the areas identified as conservation priorities are under strong anthropogenic pressures, including deforestation, agricultural expansion, and hunting. Our analysis provides a preliminary assessment of conservation priorities for the xenarthrans of Argentina, and we hope will serve as guideline to focus future conservation assessments at more refined scales. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Argentina; Priority areas; Protected area network; Species distribution models; Systematic conservation planning; Xenarthrans","Argentia; Canada; Newfoundland; Newfoundland and Labrador; anthropogenic effect; conservation planning; guideline; habitat conservation; mammal; maximum entropy analysis; prioritization; protected area; software; species occurrence","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650417250"

The purpose of this survey was to provide the baseline data required for the zonation of a large marine protected area proposed for the region. Survey work was carried out in May and June during 2002 and 2003. A seafloor map based on earlier seismic-reflection profiling data, coupled with fishers' co-ordinates of known reefs in the area, was used to plan the survey. An underwater visual census (UVC), using the point-count method, assessed fish diversity, relative abundance and size structure. During the UVC, a total of 261 point fish-counts, covering an area of 14 288m 2, was completed. A total of 138 fish species from 49 different families was identified and a relatively high proportion of endemic species (26.6%) were recorded. As a result of the turbid conditions encountered south of Mbotyi, numbers and diversity of fish species observed declined with increasing latitude. Endemic sparid linefish species, which are over-exploited in other areas, were particularly abundant in this region, and a number of new range distributions of various species were recorded during the survey. The results of this survey contributed towards the zonation of the Pondoland Marine Protected Area, which was proclaimed in June 2004.

The Finnish Forest and Park Service (Metsähallitus) was given the mandate to expand the current protected areas in southern Finland by 10 000 ha. The question is which areas should be selected out of the total area of 1 760 000 ha. The data available include a nation-wide GIS data set describing general features of forests at the resolution of 25 m × 25 m for entire Finland and another data set about biodiversity features within the current state-managed conservation areas. Ecologically, the key information includes forest age and the volume of growing stock for 20 forest types representing different productivity classes and dominant tree species. Our analysis employs four different connectivity components to identify forest areas that are (i) locally of high quality and internally well connected, (ii) well connected to surrounding high-quality forests, (iii) well connected to existing conservation areas, and (iv) large enough to allow efficient implementation. Expert evaluation of the results suggested that the present quantitative analysis was helpful in identifying areas with high conservation value systematically across southern Finland. Our analysis also showed that the highest forest conservation potential in Finland is located on privately owned land.

This makes it imperative to understand the role of land-use on landscape-scale patterns of raptors and to define priority areas for conservation. We examine landscape-scale community patterns of raptors in biogeographical zones with different degrees of anthropogenic land-use and assess the role of protected areas in maintaining such patterns. We recorded raptors along road transects in Cameroon's savannas, covering four years and 7,340-7,700 km in wet and dry seasons, in three biogeographical zones: the relatively well-preserved Inundation and Guinea zones to the north and south of the heavily exploited Sudan zone. The Inundation zone had the largest species pool and Palearctic raptor richness and abundance. The Guinea zone had the largest Afrotropical raptor species pool, while raptor diversity and richness were higher there than in the Sudan zone. The abundance of only one species (Fox Kestrel) peaked in the Sudan zone and only one large-bodied raptor (Hooded Vulture) with a Sudan-centered distribution was more common there than in the other zones. Our results suggest that land-use as determined by protected areas and human exploitation may override the role of biogeographical zonation in shaping raptor assemblages. Comparable patterns of raptor richness and diversity inside and outside protected areas suggest that both protected areas and partly cultivated peripheral zones act as important foraging and source areas, ensuring the preservation of diverse raptor assemblages at the landscape scale. Finally, our data illustrate the comparatively high richness of Cameroon's and West Africa's savanna raptor communities on a continental and global scale, underlining their importance for raptor conservation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biogeographical zones; Cameroon; Conservation; Falconiformes; Raptor community patterns","Cameroon; West Africa; Aves; Falconiformes; Necrosyrtes monachus; Raptores; abundance; Afrotropic Ecozone; anthropogenic effect; biogeographical region; conservation planning; ecological zonation; flooding; land use; population decline; prioritization; protected area; raptor; savanna; species conservation; species pool; species richness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84880062080"

The analysis is base d on Rapid Rural Appraisal techniques and focused on semi-structured interviews with the sedentary population of the study area. The situation of the population and the agricultural sector in the study area has been subject to the following three processes: the political and economical transformation, the resulting agrarian reform and the consequences of conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. Over 90% of the sedentary population are internally displaced persons (IDPs) of the territorial conflict. The majority of people earns a living from subsis tence farming, especially livestock husbandry. Grazing, especially overgrazing within the national park was identified as the main land use conflict. In orde r to accommodate the different land use interests, a zonation concept for the national park as well as the creation of a buffer zone outside the park are suggested.

Between Dec.2008 and Aug.2009 intensive camera-trapping was conducted within mosaic deciduous dipterocarp and mixeddeciduous/semi-evergreen forest in the east of Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Mondulkiri province, Cambodia. Forty camera-trap locations were set up for >2700 camera-trap nights producing 707 independent encounters of 23 mammal species. Eight globally threatened species of mammals were recorded including the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), banteng (Bos javanicus) and dhole (Cuon alpinus). Two species, the gaur (Bos gaurus) and pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina), showed significant preference for forest type (higher Relative Abundance Index of both species in mixed-deciduous/semi-evergreen forest). The mix of drier deciduous dipterocarp forest and wetter mixed-deciduous and semi-evergreen forest appears important for maintaining the conservation value of the site. Camera trap encounter rates were lower in areas within a day's walk from villages at the periphery of the protected area whilst cathemeral species displayed higher proportions of nocturnal activity than in similar studies from elsewhere in South-east Asia.

In 1995, the Statutory Framework of the World Network of biosphere reserves included a requirement that all biosphere reserves must undergo a process of periodic review once every 10 years. The primary purpose of the periodic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of biosphere reserve organizations in achieving the objectives related to three functions: biodiversity conservation, sustainable development, and logistical support. Beyond meeting statutory requirements, the periodic review process can also be considered an opportunity for learning within and beyond the national and international networks. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how management effectiveness in Canadian biosphere reserves has been interpreted through the periodic review process conducted in Canada. A content analysis was performed on the 15 periodic review reports of the 11 Canadian biosphere reserves reviewed between 1995 and 2012. Determining compliance appears to be the dominant purpose of periodic reviews, while determining and providing learning opportunities through periodic review is emerging. We conclude that periodic reviews can be used as learning tools if systematic efforts are made to evaluate, reflect, and share lessons learned.

To assist this process, we compare four methods for marine spatial planning of Madagascar's west coast. Input data for each method was drawn from the same variables: fishing pressure, exposure to climate change, and biodiversity (habitats, species distributions, biological richness, and biodiversity value). The first method compares visual color classifications of primary variables, the second uses binary combinations of these variables to produce a categorical classification of management actions, the third is a target-based optimization using Marxan, and the fourth is conservation ranking with Zonation. We present results from each method, and compare the latter three approaches for spatial coverage, biodiversity representation, fishing cost and persistence probability. All results included large areas in the north, central, and southern parts of western Madagascar. Achieving 30% representation targets with Marxan required twice the fish catch loss than the categorical method. The categorical classification and Zonation do not consider targets for conservation features. However, when we reduced Marxan targets to 16.3%, matching the representation level of the ""strict protection"" class of the categorical result, the methods show similar catch losses. The management category portfolio has complete coverage, and presents several management recommendations including strict protection. Zonation produces rapid conservation rankings across large, diverse datasets. Marxan is useful for identifying strict protected areas that meet representation targets, and minimize exposure probabilities for conservation features at low economic cost. We show that methods based on Zonation and a simple combination of variables can produce results comparable to Marxan for species representation and catch losses, demonstrating the value of comparing alternative approaches during initial stages of the planning process. Choosing an appropriate approach ultimately depends on scientific and political factors including representation targets, likelihood of adoption, and persistence goals. © 2012 Allnutt et al.","","Animals; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fishes; Madagascar; Marine Biology; Methods; article; biodiversity; climate change; coastal waters; conservation biology; controlled study; economic aspect; environmental exposure; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental protection; fishing; intermethod comparison; Madagascar; marine environment; species conservation; species distribution; species habitat; species richness; zonation; animal; comparative study; fish; marine biology; methodology; procedures","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857127192"

Regional facies differentiation was caused by differences in the morphology of the basin. A massive central reef core, exhibiting clear ecological zonation, developed along the slope of the slightly deeper eastern part of the basin. The shallower western parts, however, were quickly filled up by forereef debris and overlain by sediments of the rapidly spreading lagoon. A typical grapestone facies includes intercalations of vadose pisolitic crusts, thus indicating a shallow marine platform environment, which was sporadically interrupted by areas of subaerial exposure. Various sediment types occurring along the platform margin reflect synsedimentary mass movements. These were induced by tectonic disturbances caused by different rates of subsidence between the rapidly subsiding platform and the slowly subsiding basin. Forereef rocks which have been entirely lithified were affected by various stages of internal brecciation during this process. In contrast, basinal sediments which were semilithified or patchily cemented exhibit plastic deformation (slumping) and subsequent disintegration into intraformational breccias and debris flows. Turbidites were induced in cases of higher pore water saturations. All these mass mobilisations took place on gentle slopes. This assumption is supported by the observation of initial reef growth flourishing on protected areas of the foreslope. Along a gentle slope, differential rates of subsidence can easily be balanced by plastic deformation and dislocation of basinal material. This is supported by the fact that no prominent synsedimentary fault system could be observed along the platform margin. The facies differentiation of the central reef core is substantiated by a clear eclogical zonation of organisms. The lower, more protected portions of the central reef belt were occupied by the Tubiphytes zones. Along the reef front the Coral-Solenoporacean biocoenoses found favorable living conditions. The high energy sediments of the reef flat exhibit a highly diverse Calcisponge-Hydrozoan-Coral community. Towards backreef areas a small belt was inhabited by a typical Thecosmilia -Thaumatoporella biocenosis. © 1982 Institut für Paläontologie Universität Erlangen.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-51649166598"

EU member states have legal responsibilities for evaluating the condition of and maintaining their national networks. While it is desirable to maintain the condition of the N2k network or even improve it by habitat restoration, it is a fact that national environmental bodies operate under budgetary constraints - money available for conservation is limited. Consequently, there may be a need to prioritize targeting of conservation effort in and around the N2k network. In this study we develop a high-resolution spatial conservation prioritization for the Finnish national N2k network, using data about the distribution and quality of 68 N2k habitats occurring in Finland. The aim of the work is to identify management landscapes, landscapes that have exceptionally high conservation value and which could be managed as one management unit. We identify top-priority areas of the N2k network. We also identify highest-priority N2k areas that do not have the status of a protected area in the Finnish legislation.

However, the lack of zoning is common for most protected areas in developing countries and, as a consequence, many protected areas are not effective in achieving the goals for which they were created. In this work, we introduce a quantitative method to expeditiously zone protected areas and we evaluate its ecological implications on hypothetical zoning cases. A real-world application is reported for the Talampaya National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Argentina. Our method is a modification of the zoning forest model developed by Bos [Bos, J., 1993. Zoning in forest management: a quadratic assignment problem solved by simulated annealing. Journal of Environmental Management 37, 127-145.]. Main innovations involve a quadratic function of distance between land units, non-reciprocal weights for adjacent land uses (mathematically represented by a non-symmetric matrix), and the possibility of imposing a connectivity constraint. Due to its intrinsic spatial dimension, the zoning problem belongs to the NP-hard class, i.e. a solution can only be obtained in non-polynomial time [Nemhausser, G., Wolsey, L., 1988. Integer and Combinatorial Optimization. John Wiley, New York.]. For that purpose, we applied a simulated annealing heuristic implemented as a FORTRAN language routine. Our innovations were effective in achieving zoning designs more compatible with biological diversity protection. The quadratic distance term facilitated the delineation of core zones for elements of significance; the connectivity constraint minimized fragmentation; non-reciprocal land use weightings contributed to better representing management decisions, and influenced mainly the edge and shape of zones. This quantitative method can assist the zoning process within protected areas by offering many zonation scheme alternatives with minimum cost, time and effort. This ability provides a new tool to improve zoning within protected areas in developing countries. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The division of areas makes it possible to order information and justify the 'continuity' of ecological and economic functions in the given area.

A principal goal of protected-area networks is to maintain viable populations of as many species as possible, particularly those that are vulnerable to environmental change outside reserves. Ideally, one wants to be able to protect all biodiversity when selecting priority areas for conservation. 2. Using the area-prioritization algorithm ZONATION, we identified the locations where UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species of mammals, birds, herptiles, butterflies and plants occur in concentrated populations with high connectivity. Both these features are likely to be correlated with population persistence. The analyses were successful in maintaining a high proportion of the connectivity of narrow-range species, and large total amounts of the connectivity of wider-range species over 10% of the land surface of Great Britain. 3. Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP - high priority) species of one taxonomic group were not particularly good surrogates (indicators) for BAP species of other taxonomic groups. Hence, maintaining population concentrations of one taxonomic group did not guarantee doing likewise for other taxa. 4. Species with narrow geographic ranges were most effective at predicting conservation success for other species, probably because they represent the range of environmental conditions required by other species. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study identifies landscape-scale priority areas for conservation of priority species from several taxonomic groups, using the Zonation software. 'Indicator groups' were only partially successful as predictors of priority areas for other taxonomic groups, and therefore, the identification of priority areas for biodiversity conservation should include information from all taxonomic groups available. Larger areas should be protected to account for species not included in the analyses. Conservation solutions based on data for many different species, and particularly those species with narrowly defined ranges, appear to be most effective at protecting other rare taxa. © 2008 The Authors.","Amphibians; Biodiversity; Birds; Butterflies; Conservation; Mammals; Plants; Protected areas; Reptiles; Zonation","Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Amphibia; Aves; Mammalia; Papilionoidea; Reptilia; biodiversity; connectivity; environmental protection; nature conservation; nature reserve; persistence; prioritization; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-58249106866"

New strategies are required to more effectively select MPA locations and increase the pace of their implementation. Many criteria exist to design MPA networks, but generally, it is recommended that networks conserve a diversity of species selected for, among other attributes, their representativeness, rarity, or endemicity. Because knowledge of species' spatial distribution remains scarce, efficient surrogates are urgently needed. We used five different levels of habitat maps and six spatial scales of analysis to identify under which circumstances habitat data used to design MPA networks for Wallis Island provided better representation of species than random choice alone. Protected-area site selections were derived from a rarity-complementarity algorithm. Habitat surrogacy was tested for commercial fish species, all fish species, commercially harvested invertebrates, corals, and algae species. Efficiency of habitat surrogacy varied by species group, type of habitat map, and spatial scale of analysis. Maps with the highest habitat thematic complexity provided better surrogates than simpler maps and were more robust to changes in spatial scales. Surrogates were most efficient for commercial fishes, corals, and algae but not for commercial invertebrates. Conversely, other measurements of species-habitat associations, such as richness congruence and composition similarities provided weak results. We provide, in part, a habitat-mapping methodology for designation of MPAs for Pacific Ocean islands that are characterized by habitat zonations similar to Wallis. Given the increasing availability and affordability of space-borne imagery to map habitats, our approach could appreciably facilitate and improve current approaches to coral reef conservation and enhance MPA implementation. ©2010 Society for Conservation Biology.","Accumulation curves; Biodiversity surrogacy; Marine protected area; Millennium coral reef mapping project; Remote sensing; Richness congruence; Wallis","Algae; Animals; Anthozoa; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fishes; Invertebrates; Pacific Islands; Population Dynamics; Wallis and Futuna; Wallis Islands; algae; Anthozoa; Invertebrata; Pisces; algal community; conservation management; coral reef; endemic species; habitat conservation; habitat type; marine park; project management; remote sensing; site selection; species conservation; species diversity; alga; animal; Anthozoa; article; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental protection; fish; invertebrate; methodology; Pacific islands; population dynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954155611"

A pressing issue is the role of Protected Area networks under future climate change, because of the shifting of species distributions polewards due to climate warming. In this study we use two techniques in conservation science, first, to estimate the likely impacts on the distributions of mammals and butterflies in Egypt (MaxEnt), and second, to measure the effectiveness of Egypt's Protected Area network (Zonation). We predict that future climate will have significant effects on species richness and the relative value for conservation of sites in Egypt: some areas will increase in species richness, whilst others will decrease significantly. Currently, the sites of highest relative conservation value are found in the Nile Delta, south-eastern and Sinai regions of Egypt and along the Mediterranean and Red Sea coastlines, with Protected Areas having a higher conservation value than unprotected areas. Under future climate scenarios the relative conservation value of Protected Areas are predicted initially to decline and then gradually increase by the 2080s. It is predicted that many areas, especially the Nile Delta and the southeast, will require extra protection in the future; areas that are currently not protected, but have high species richness and conservation value, may need to be protected to prevent loss of biodiversity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Biodiversity; Conservation; Species distributions; Zonation","Egypt; Mammalia; Papilionoidea; biodiversity; butterfly; climate change; climate effect; conservation management; future prospect; mammal; population distribution; protected area; warming","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84873101158"

Using survey and interview data from 36 communities in the Central Visayas, key variables are identified that are correlated with and predictive of marine protected area success. Empirically based management guidelines are: (1) EBM and MPA design must be context appropriate, (2) capacity development to develop MPA leadership and the technical skills are a good investment, (3) strict and fair punishment for infractions of legitimate rules should be utilized and appear to be welcomed by local residents, and (4) conflict and controversy are a predictable part of MPA design and implementation and need to be planned for. Most importantly, while scaling up management interventions can make both biological and institutional sense, there is a point at which institutional capacity is exceeded. This study strongly suggests that in the Philippines, and likely many other tropical contexts, establishing large-scale EBM, MPA networks, or extensive centrally planned zonation schemes based primarily on national law, international targets, and command-and-control policy are likely to fail.

According to the National Habitat Classification and Map of the Republic of Croatia, there are 25 habitat types in the area of the nature park. Five of these are endangered at the European level and protected by the Habitats Directive. Kopački Rit Nature Park has been included on the Ramsar list as valuable natural heritage within the international framework. The floodplain area of Kopački Rit is essential due to the coherence and diversity of terrestrial and aquatic ecological systems. The paper addresses the need for ecological and spatial valorisation of the protected area as an instrument for discriminating between primary and secondary protection. Kopački Rit is a floodplain area resulting from the activity of two large rivers: the Danube and the Drava. Spatial analysis of Kopački Rit Nature Park was made on the basis of the existing spatial plan (2006) of the area. Comparative methods, as well as the analysis and synthesis method were used for the process. A qualitative analytical method with element gradation within four analysis fields was used - strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT analysis). A structural area analysis (Figure 1) was made according to Lynch (1972). The effect of the activities on biological and landscape diversity was analyzed in the results. The analysis included the effects of forestry, water management, agriculture, game management, traffic, and war events (Table 1 and 2). Based on the management plan, zonation was performed by defining the main zones and determining the sub-zones (Figure 2). The zones were described and the zonation criteria and management goals were provided. In doing so, the difference between the zones of strict protection and active protection was accentuated. The goal of management is to ensure a sustainable use of floodplain valleys and allow visits, recreational fishing, hunting, forestry and agriculture. In order to improve habitat quality, use of the area should be limited by management measures. Ecological and spatial analyses of the protected nature park area were used to determine the difference between individual units within Kopački Rit. Special zones of the basic phenomenon were highlighted, which coincides with the zoning concept within the nature park. In this sense, primary and secondary protection was discriminated.","Diversity; Habitat; Nature protection; Sustainable development; Zoning","Agriculture; Ecosystems; Forestry; Forests; Sustainable Forest Management; Water Management; Croatia; Kopacki Rit Nature Park; Banks (bodies of water); Ecosystems; Forestry; Management; Parks; Spatial variables measurement; Sustainable development; Timber; Water management; Zoning; Active protection; Analysis and synthesis; Comparative methods; Croatia; Diversity; Ecological systems; European levels; Flood plains; Game management; Habitat; Habitat classification; Habitat quality; Habitat type; Landscape diversity; Large rivers; Management goals; Management measures; Management plans; Nature protection; Protected areas; Qualitative analytical methods; Secondary protection; Spatial analysis; Sustainable use; SWOT analysis; Valorisation; comparative study; environmental economics; floodplain; globalization; habitat quality; habitat type; protected area; qualitative analysis; species diversity; sustainable development; water management; zoning; Environmental protection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052999150"

Thus it is unclear whether tropical PAs are well-placed for conserving biodiversity currently, or under future climate change. We used reserve-design software ('Zonation') to investigate current and future conservation value of PAs of Thailand (N=187 PAs, covering ∼20% of Thailand) in relation to forest-cover and butterfly diversity. Currently, PAs are about 2°C cooler than non-PAs because PAs tend to occur at higher elevation (66% of land above 1000m is protected compared with only 6% below 250m). Temperature is predicted to increase in Thailand in future, but PAs are predicted to remain ∼2°C cooler than non-PAs in future. We obtained modelled distribution data for 161 butterfly species (∼12% of national butterfly fauna), and used Zonation to rank areas (∼1km 2 grid resolution) based on species richness, complementarity, and forest cover. The conservation value of PAs was approximately twice that of non-PA areas, although many highly-ranked areas are not currently protected. The species richness of PAs was projected to decline by ∼30% in future, but the relative conservation rankings of individual PAs were projected to change very little. The preponderance of PAs in montane regions makes them well-placed to support forest species shifting from areas at lower elevation that become climatically unsuitable in future. By contrast, the conservation value of low-elevation PAs may decline in future if climate conditions become unsuitable for species. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Habitat connectivity; Lepidoptera; Reserve design; SE Asia; Zonation","Thailand; Lepidoptera; Papilionoidea; butterfly; climate change; climate conditions; connectivity; ecological modeling; ecological zonation; efficiency measurement; elevation; forest cover; future prospect; habitat management; montane forest; population decline; protected area; ranking; reserve design; software; species conservation; species diversity; species richness; tropical forest","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860389370"

Of these, a seed cell selection procedure works by evaluating potential cells for protection one by one, picking the one that maximizes the objective function, adding seed cells. This continues to full protection of the project area. The other is a Monte Carlo approach, which uses a likelihood sampling procedure based on weighted importance layers of conservation interest to evaluate alternative protected area sizing and placement. This is similar to the objective function of Marxan, a priority-selection decision-support tool based on optimization algorithms using geographic information system data. The two approaches are alternative options in a common spatial optimization module, which uses the time- and spatial-dynamic Ecospace model for the evaluations. The optimizations are implemented as components of the Ecopath with Ecosim approach and software. In a case study, we find that there can be protected area zoning that will accommodate economical and social factors, without causing ecological deterioration.

MPAs encompass a range of protection levels, from fully protected no-take reserves to restriction of only particular activities, gear types, user groups, target species, or extraction periods. There is a growing body of scientific evidence supporting the ecological benefits of full reserve protection, but it is more difficult to generalize about the effects of other types of MPAs, in part because they include a range of actual protection levels. However, it is critical to determine whether partial protection and no-take reserves provide similar ecological benefits given potential economic costs of lost fishing grounds in no-take areas, common sociopolitical opposition to full protection, and promotion of partially protected areas as a compromise solution in ocean zoning disputes. Here we synthesize all empirical studies comparing biological measures (biomass, density, species richness, and size of organisms) in no-take marine reserves and adjacent partially protected and unprotected areas across a range of geographic locations worldwide. We demonstrate that while partially protected areas may confer some benefits over open access areas, no-take reserves generally show greater benefits and yield significantly higher densities of organisms within their boundaries relative to partially protected sites nearby. © Inter-Research 2008.","Conservation; Marine protected areas; Marine reserves; Ocean zoning; Protection level","coastal zone management; conservation management; ecological zonation; empirical analysis; marine park; population density","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-53949105031"

We present in this review a general description of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the northwestern Mediterranean and some general principles for the establishment of protected areas, including their size, location, biotope composition, regulation, and management. 2. Many Mediterranean MPAs are located around or adjacent to islands, but the placement of a marine reserve close to a large urban area is not necessarily a handicap, as has been demonstrated by some examples. It is not, therefore, necessary to restrict future MPAs solely to regions of low human density. 3. The conceptual question of MPA size (single large or several small SLOSS debate) has never been explicitly considered in the selection of Mediterranenan MPAs. However, studies of fish recruitment in MPAs, and the development of a network of small MPAs between Spain and France have highlighted the importance and value of small sized MPAs (200-2000 ha). 4. Whatever the location of a future MPA, its success as measured in terms of stock restoration will depend on whether (i) sufficient suitable habitat is available, (ii) the variety and abundance of prey species are adequate and (iii) the possibilities for recruitment of the biota are reasonable. 5. The initial choices of zonation and legislation regulating the management of any future MPA are of primary importance. The zonation plan should be as simple as possible (gradation of 2 or 3 levels) and it should be acknowledged that the significance of management conflicts within a MPA will be inversely proportional to the extent of preliminary consultations with all of the users, both professional and amateur. 6. The examples of semi-protected areas where professional fishing is still allowed demonstrate without ambiguity the negative impact of spear-fishing, and the limited impacts from regulated professional activities on fish assemblages. The means of regulating consist essentially of (i) a prohibition of certain type of fishing methods (trawling); and (ii) a limitation of the numbers of fishermen by a system of restriction or authorization. 7. In the MPAs examined, there is a great diversity of situations in relation to the size of and distribution of duties between staff assigned to their management. However, the single most important factor underlying whether or not a MPA will be successful and beneficial is the presence of a dedicated staff. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Management; Marine protected areas; Mediterranean; Protection; Review","Mediterranean Region; management; marine environment; protected area; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034955849"

In preliminary surveys on the Maputaland coast we observed a distinct zonation of vegetation and hypothesized that local environmental variables influenced the gradient of species richness. Inventories of plant, insect and bird species richness were collected in selected 10 x 10m plots along an east-west transect at Mabibi, South Africa, over a three year period through rapid assessment. Environmental data on meteorological conditions and soil nutrients were collected at the same five sites. Based on the number of unique species found in each site, our work indicates a gradient in the distribution of plants, birds and insects in the coastal dunes of Mabibi. Kruskal Wallis tests used to determine the significance of environmental gradients along the east-west gradient were ambiguous in most cases due to the limited degrees of freedom. Correlations between biota and environmental variables showed a positive significant relationship between insects and temperature.

These sediments are the oldest deposits cropping out in the study area, which belongs to the large Apulian carbonate platform. Field investigations evidences a gradient of facies related to different depositional settings: from west to east, inner shelf, lagoonal and shelf-edge facies can be distinguished. Inner shelf environments, represented by micritic limestones locally arranged in shallowing upward sequences, are visible in the western part of the peninsula. Their fossil content is of low taxonomic diversity and consists mainly of small-sized requieniid and radiolitid rudists, isolated or in bouquets, foraminifers and algae. Limestones with spectacular and well-preserved ichtyofaunas, testifying to the existence of open environments, are intercalated locally within these inner shelf facies (Alessano, Porto Selvaggio and Nardò). In the southeastern part of the peninsula, shelf-edge sequences of varying thickness crop out (Serra di Poggiardo); the distinctive sediments are carbonate mounds and sand banks (biodetrital packstones and grainstones) formed in the winnowed, shallow subtidal marginal facies, yielding various macrofaunal assemblages. The main sediment contributors are rudists, with predominant recumbent robust radiolitids (i.e. large specimens of Favus antei and Sabinia klinghardti), and mixed assemblages with clusters of clingers and robust solitary elevator hippuritids (Vaccinites spp.) and radiolitids (Joufia reticulata, Durania austinensis, Colveraia variabilis). Open marine platform environments (open lagoons and bays) are found in the lee of the outer platform edge (Porto Badisco and Santa Cesarea); they formed in shallow, protected areas, where radiolitid biostromes developed. More elevated areas, where laminated sands were deposited, show a community dominated by gastropods, crabs and neanic shells of ammonites: the latter occur also in other localities. Stratified calcirudites and calcarenites intercalating with fine calcarenites and calcilutites with planktic and benthic foraminifers (Ciolo locality) can be referred to the outer part of the shelf-margin fades. Biostratigraphically, rudist assemblages allow a distinction between Late Campanian outcrops (Otranto, Porto Badisco, S. Cesarea, Serra di Poggiardo, Melissano, and S. Caterina) and Maastrichtian outcrops (Ciolo, Galatina, and Veglie). These age assignments are in agreement with standard zonations based on foraminifera.","Apulia; Leite Cretaceous; Paleoecology; Rudists; Salento; Southern Italy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0004966878"

Several such software programmes have been developed in recent years, each differing in the underlying algorithms used. Here, an investigation is made into whether the choice of software influences the location of priority areas by comparing outputs from Marxan and Zonation, two widely used conservation-planning, decision-support tools. Using biological and socio-economic data from the eastern English Channel, outputs are compared and it is shown that the two software packages identified similar sets of priority areas, although the relatively wide distribution of habitat types and species considered offered much flexibility. Moreover, the similarity increased with increasing spatial constraint, especially when using real-world cost data, suggesting that the choice of cost metric has a greater influence on conservation-planning analyses than the choice of software. However, Marxan generally produced more efficient results and Zonation produced results with greater connectivity, so the most appropriate software package will depend on the overall goals of the MPA planning process. © 2011 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

To this aim we: (1) evaluated the affinities of political entities of tropical America with the Yucatan Peninsula, considering the distribution of tree species occurring in the latter region; (2) assessed floristic affinities between political entities of the Yucatan Peninsula based on endemic species; (3) defined biogeographical districts for the Mexican portion of the Yucatan Peninsula; and (4) evaluated the conservation status of endemic species in the area. Location: The Yucatan Peninsula is a biogeographical area comprising the entire territory of the Mexican states Campeche, Quintana Roo, and Yucatan, adjacent small portions of Tabasco and Chiapas, the El Petén department in Guatemala, and the northern half of Belize. Because of heterogeneous data availability some analyses were restricted to the first three above listed Mexican states (YP1), which comprise the core of the Yucatan Peninsula. Methods: Distributional data of 434 tree species were obtained from three sources: inspection of 7640 herbarium specimens, specialist advice regarding the taxonomic status of the tree species, and an extensive review of taxonomic and floristic literature. We based the various analyses of phytogeographical affinities on Jaccard's Index. Information on individual species distributions was subjected to a multivariate analysis. Occurrence of endemic species in five existing protected areas in the Yucatan Peninsula was analysed by examining floristic checklists available for them. Results: Affinities of the tree flora of YP1 with twenty-four political entities of tropical America generally decreased as geographical distances from this region increased. Distributional patterns of the seventy-two tree species endemic to YP2 showed the strongest affinities to exist between Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucatan, and in turn these entities displayed a large similarity with Belize and Guatemala. Regionalization of YP1, based on the distributions of both all species and the endemic ones, led to the distinction of two districts: a smaller one in the north-western corner, and a larger one comprising the remaining areas. Although the distributions of numerous species in the two groups matched the limits of these districts, ubiquitous species of panpeninsular distribution also occurred. For YP1 we identified nineteen endemic trees, indicating a percent endemism of 4.4 for this area. Of the sixty-four species endemic to YP2 which occur in YP1, fifty-two (81.2%) have been recorded in at least one of the five protected areas of this territory (three occurred in the five preserves and nineteen did so in a single one), whereas twelve (18.8%) were not found in any protected area. Main conclusions: The definition of the Yucatan Peninsula as a biogeographical province was confirmed. The strongest floristic affinities of YP1 were with Mesoamerican entities, whereas affinities with the Antilles were much weaker. The distinction of two biogeographical districts corresponds closely to the peninsula's climatic and vegetational zonation. This regionalization agrees partially with schemes proposed for other animal and plant groups. Further inventory work in protected areas is needed to adequately assess the conservation status of the Yucatan Peninsula's tree endemics.","Biogeographical regionalization; Endemism; Mesoamerica; Mexico; Phytogeography; Tree biogeography; Trees; Yucatan Peninsula","Mexico; Animalia; biogeography; conservation status; endemism; floristics; tree","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036179503"
