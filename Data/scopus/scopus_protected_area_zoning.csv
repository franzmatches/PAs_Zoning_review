Stakeholder engagement in MPA design can contribute to increasing integration. This study focuses on the co-design of an MPA between researchers, public administration, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations. The proposed MPA is in Portugal and includes an area that is a hotspot for biodiversity and economic activities. This is the first MPA proposal in mainland Portugal co-designed using a participatory approach. This study highlights the steps of the zoning process and synthesizes the eight main lessons learned, useful for other cases, particularly for relatively small coastal MPAs with multiple socioeconomic activities. Three zoning proposals were developed and discussed within the participatory process. The proposals considered the best scientific and local knowledge available and were defined using ecological, socioeconomic, and shape-area guiding principles. In an iterative manner and following a participatory approach, compromises with stakeholders were achieved, and a final proposal, scientifically sound and socially accepted by most stakeholders, was delivered to the government. The final zoning plan will achieve ambitious conservation goals, including the largest fully protected area to be declared in mainland Portugal, while minimizing the impacts on the existing economic activities and promoting its sustainability. This process resulted in valuable lessons that may be applied elsewhere and guide future MPA implementation or rezoning of existing ones. These transdisciplinary and participatory processes can be time and resource-consuming but are vital for ensuring MPA effectiveness.

Here, we examine the efficacy of two kinds of PPAs (with and without spearfishing) within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) that are subject to a range of fishing limitations, and assess their utility as a marine park zoning and fisheries management tool. Fish abundance, size, and habitat composition were compared inside PPAs and NTMRs on inshore reefs of the central GBR. Fish abundances were lower inside PPAs relative to adjacent NTMRs for primary fishing targets, with no detectable effects for secondary targets and non-targets, or for species richness. Fish assemblages differed amongst zones, but these variations were minor compared to regional variations in species composition. Partially Protected Areas supported 46%–69% of the relative abundance of total primary targets compared to adjacent NTMRs, with no evident increase in abundance in zones where spearfishing was prohibited. There were no reductions in the size of two key target species: coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) and stripey snapper (Lutjanus carponotatus) inside PPAs, and only stripey snapper had significant reductions in abundance inside PPAs compared to NTMRS. Habitat and biophysical characteristics (especially topographic complexity) were strong drivers of fish abundance, but the relative influence of zone was greater for target species compared to non-targets. This study provides novel data on PPAs and highlights their utility as a spatial management tool in contributing to conservation and fisheries management goals. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conservation; Fish assemblages; Fisheries; Great Barrier Reef; Marine Protected Area; Zoning","Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Queensland; Lutjanus carponotatus; Microcanthus strigatus; Plectropomus; environmental management; fishery management; marine park; nature conservation; protected area; reef; relative abundance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105438293"

The results showed that from the perspective of cultivated land use efficiency, the average value of cultivated land use comprehensive efficiency in Yuanyang County was 0.837, the overall level was not high, and there was a large space for improvement of pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency. According to the evaluation results of cultivated land suitability, the suitable arable area, basic suitable arable area, low suitable arable area and basin protection area accounted for 37.84%, 41.36%, 19.09% and 1.71% of the total cultivated land in Yuanyang County, respectively, and the arable ability was strong. The cultivated land use efficiency in Yuanyang County was divided into conservation area, promotion area, adjustment area and protection area by superposition of the evaluation results of cultivated land use efficiency and arable land suitability.From the perspective of sustainable utilization and ecological protection, combining with differentiated remediation measures, in the conservation area, maintaining high arable land, arable land use efficiency and extending the ecological and economic value of arable land were the key points.The promotion area had strong arable and low cultivated land use efficiency. It can maximize its effective use efficiency through large-scale operation.In the adjustment area, the suitable tillage was poor, and the utilization efficiency of cultivated land should not be improved. Ecological agriculture or facility hydroponic agriculture should be developed to improve the economic benefits of cultivated land and alleviate the pressure of cultivated land and ecological protection. The cultivated land in the protected area would be withdrawn gradually, and its wetland and ecological functions would be brought into full play.

To balance the needs of conservation and development, the national parks will adopt a zoning designation to delimit land in the parks for different purposes. These include a core zone that covers critical areas for conservation and allows few human uses, and a control zone that permits a wider range of development activities. However, the efficacy and management challenges of this zoning scheme are largely unknown. Using the Giant Panda National Park (GPNP) in Sichuan Province as an example, we evaluated the efficacy of the park's zoning designations by assessing the spatial distribution of critical habitat areas for panda conservation and human disturbance across different zones. Our results show that the core zone of the GPNP performs well in covering the majority of panda habitat (80%), highly suitable habitat (81%), and habitat patches that can support a viable panda population (80%). There is still space for improvement, however, because a significant portion (39%) of the potential corridors that require strict protections fall outside the core zone. Human disturbances are prevalent in the core zone of the park, representing a major challenge to achieving the management goal of eliminating human disturbances in the core zone. Our analyses and methods provide crucial information and tools to inform the design and management of the zoning designations of the GPNP and other PAs in China and beyond. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Giant Panda National Park; Habitat connectivity; Habitat suitability; Human disturbances; Protected areas; Zoning designations","Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Trachinotus falcatus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099612828"

However, the generalised zoning of PAs leads to local conflicts, often caused by the scale mismatch between the generalised zoning and the social-ecological systems. Generalised zoning approaches offer only single-scale management practices, hence zoning tends to cover large areas where local social-ecological systems are neglected. This study aims to develop and test a local-scale participatory zoning approach for PAs to resolve local conflicts. The proposed approach is developed using a landscape services framework, starting with a progressive stakeholder analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the local social-ecological system, involving the identification of stakeholders and landscape service typology, differentiating between and categorising stakeholders and investigating relationships between stakeholders. Lastly, facilitate stakeholder collaboration to develop a consensus zoning scheme based on these understandings. This was tested in Baoku Valley (China) to reveal the strengths and limitations of the approach and provide a case for application in other PAs. Eighteen stakeholders and twenty-five landscape services were identified. The stakeholders were divided into three groups according to their preferences for landscape services and the spatial relationships between the three stakeholder groups were identified. A consensus zoning scheme consisting of five zones was then developed by the stakeholders in a workshop. The results suggest that the local-scale participatory zoning approach can help resolve local conflicts in PAs by dividing conflict areas into more precise planning units and providing more fine-scaled management strategies matched to local social-ecological systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","China; Conservation planning; Land management conflict; Landscape service; Participatory spatial planning; Scale mismatch","China; conservation management; conservation planning; landscape ecology; landscape planning; participatory approach; protected area; spatial planning; stakeholder; strategic approach","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146064649"

It can be compensated or allocated by restoring the vegetation on the property itself or in another one. The large-scale restorations projects have a high cost, so it is important to develop forest restoration methodologies that assist in decision making, to identify factors and to map possibilities of allocation of RL. Thus, we aimed to map priority areas for allocating legal reserves and for restoration, a problem of land planning in a general position, applying it to an specific example of the company Suzano S.A. as a case study, the largest pulp and paper company in Latin America, and to discuss the applicability of used criteria. We expect that this methodology would show how much priority and where legal reserves should be allocated, in order to comply with Brazilian legislation. For that, we used Geographic Information System (GIS) and Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). Selection of criteria was based on territorial planning that assist in forest restoration and of importance to Suzano and they were analyzed by a Hierarchical Analytical Process (AHP) to differentiate the importance of each criterion. According to the Brazil forest code, priority areas for RL allocation should consider river basin plans, Ecological-Economic Zoning, ecological corridors connection with protected areas, sites with greatest importance for the conservation of biodiversity and areas of environmental fragility. We found that most part of the state was classified as lower importance priority areas. Instead, current location of Suzano Legal Reserves is mostly in areas that have higher priorities for RL allocation. Thus, allocation or compensation of environmental debts in other basins, as the New Forest Code allows, should be taken with care, as legal reserves might be placed in low priority areas. Critic watersheds criteria determined the outcomes, but also the priority areas defined by São Paulo state.

The purpose of this study is to suggest the way of zoning that can perform the functions of conservation, development, and logistics support of biosphere reserves. Methods: To meet the purpose of this study, the designation criteria, restrictions, and permissions of the protected area specified in the law for domestic protected areas were reviewed to classify the functions of a biosphere reserve. Results: Through this classification, 10 domestic protected areas with high ecological protection value, such as the natural beauty of the ecosystem, biodiversity, and habitats for wild animals and plants were derived as the core areas of the biosphere reserves. Also, a total of 21 protected zones that can function as a buffer to protect the core of the natural ecosystem from indiscriminate development such as resource protection, recovery, pollution prevention, and improvement were derived as appropriate sites for a buffer. In the review process, issues such as different behavioral restrictions and ranges of permission due to the application of different laws were identified, if two or more protected areas exist within one of the protected areas, there is a protected area that does not meet the criteria for designating use zone, or where behavior restrictions do not meet the zoning criteria of biosphere reserve, under the laws of domestic protected areas. Conclusion: Although this study was not able to carefully review most of the laws on domestic protected areas that are linked to other laws, it was able to categorize appropriate domestic protected areas that can act as the core and buffer zones of biosphere reserves. © 2021 by the Society for People, Plants, and Environment.","Buffer area; Core area; Designation standards; Restrictions on acts","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103418934"

Ecosystem-based management (EBM) in British Columbia began with the development of land use plans in the 1990s to address coastal and land use issues related to terrestrial land management. Managing marine resources is challenging on Canada's Pacific coast because of multiple, overlapping jurisdictions, unceded indigenous territories, and lack of coordination amongst governments in the region and their agencies. The Marine Plan Partnership for the North Pacific Coast (MaPP) was formed in 2011 and was a co-led partnership between 18 First Nations’ and the Province of British Columbia governments. The purpose of the MaPP Initiative was to develop and implement marine plans for 102,000 square kilometers of coastal and offshore water in northern British Columbia. A co-led governance framework included the member First Nations and the Provincial government structured into multiple levels of decisions making, conflict resolution, and technical support. Integral to the planning process was broad and continual stakeholder engagement through multiple advisory committees as well as public engagement. The planning process made use of multiple information sources including traditional, scientific, and local knowledge and was completed in 3.5 years. The result was the development and signing into policy of four sub-regional marine plans (one for each of the four MaPP sub-regions: Haida Gwaii, North Coast, Central Coast, and North Vancouver Island) and a Regional Action Framework. The sub-regional plans delineate protection, special, and general management zones for multiple objectives and will inform future policy decisions for marine protected areas, tenures, resource management and coastal development through an EBM approach. The plans will inform permits for marine tenures including aquaculture, offshore renewable energy siting, contribute to Canada's marine protected areas network, and improve coastal infrastructure. The Regional Action Framework highlights activities to occur across the entire region through five main activity areas (Regional Governance, Ecological Integrity and Human Well-being, Compliance and Enforcement, Cumulative Effects Assessment, and Zoning Recommendations). Funding for planning was through a public-private model that also supported the development of the plans and decision support tools (e.g. planning and mapping portal). Discussions regarding implementation began during the planning phase to ensure long-term commitment from the Partners and continuity to improve decision making and management within the MaPP area. The process design and methodology created by MaPP can be a model for planning in areas that involve multiple authorities, complex geographies and jurisdictional arrangements that can be scaled up for regional, cross border, and transboundary marine spatial planning. © 2020","Ecosystem based management; Governance; Indigenous based planning; Marine conservation; Marine spatial planning; Zoning","British Columbia; Canada; Pacific Coast [Canada]; Pacific Coast [North America]; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); conservation management; decision support system; ecosystem management; governance approach; land use planning; marine policy; partnership approach; planning process; resource management; spatial planning; zoning policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086739088"

Having a biodiversity rich maritime area of 118,813 km2, Bangladesh is facing the challenges of environmental change and over exploitation. Thus, conservation efforts are urgently needed for the coastal and marine ecosystems of Bangladesh. Taking this into account this study aims at assessing the suitability of the Saint Martin – Teknaf Peninsula of south-east coastal zone of Bangladesh to delineate as MPA considering four protection levels (i.e. no entry - no take zone; entry - no take zone; partial reserve and general reserve zones). Primary data on socio-economic status, biodiversity and habitat condition were collected through a year-long field observation. We used the spatial multiple-criteria analysis technique to determine the suitability of the Saint Martin – Teknaf Peninsula to declare as MPA. We found that local communities are mainly involved with fishing and tourism based activities for their livelihoods. The study also found about 900 species which includes critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable species. Both social and biodiversity data suggest that conservation efforts are urgently required for the Saint Martin – Teknaf Peninsula. Present study identified 2992.29 km2 potential area of the Saint Maritn – Teknaf Peninsula for MPA declaration. Potential no-entry, no-take zone covers an area of 44.37 km2 while entry, no-take; partial reserve and general reserve zones cover 710.92, 1436 and 801 km2 area, respectively. Our study will serve as a model example to delineate the MPA zones with different protection levels for tropical and sub-tropical marine systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bay of Bengal; Biodiversity; Conservation; MPA delineation; Saint Martin's Island; Socio-economic; Tropical","Bangladesh; Chittagong [Bangladesh]; Teknaf Game Reserve; biodiversity; coastal zone management; conservation management; conservation planning; protected area; socioeconomic conditions; tropical environment; zoning system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113656783"

Solitary wasps are important natural predators of agricultural and forestry pests and are also important environmental biological indicators. In this study, we aimed to assess the relationship between spatial distribution of species diversity on solitary wasps (Vespidae) and functional zoning in the Chebaling National Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province. Methods: From 2018 to 2020, we investigated the diversity and distribution of Vespidae wasps and their driving factors in a typical subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in Nanling using artificial trap-nests and km-grid protocols (a total of 100 survey grids with a grid size of 1 km × 1 km) across the whole region and its surrounding areas in the Chebaling Nature Reserve. Results: In this study, a total of 4,156 wasp nesting tubes and 9,973 incubation chambers were obtained, and 9 wasp species were identified, distributed in 89 grids, and the distribution map of their species richness and abundance was drawn. The results indicated that elevation, the distance to the nearest settlement, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) may act as the key environmental factors affecting species richness, abundance, and distribution of the wasp community. Species richness, the nest number, and brood cells of Vespidae wasps decreased significantly with increasing elevation, and species richness and abundance were much higher when the sites were closer to the settlement. However, the α-diversity index of the wasp community demonstrated a pattern with an initial increase and then decrease with EVI. The overall β-diversity, species turnover, and the nestedness of the wasp community was 0.21, 0.05, and 0.16, respectively, which indicates that the nestedness was the main distribution pattern of the wasp community in the nature reserve. Distance redundancy analysis demonstrated that species turnover was significantly influenced by elevation, whereas the nestedness was not affected by any environmental factor involved in this paper. The abundance of nests or brood cells outside the nature reserve were significantly higher than those in the other three functional zones, while all α-diversity indices (species richness, Shannon diversity, Simpson diversity, and evenness) indicated no significant differences amongst the four functional zones. This suggests that the wasp communities had similar species composition and no obvious distribution boundary across all the functional zones in this nature reserve. Conclusion: Based on the grid survey in the Chebaling National Nature Reserve, this study mapped the spatial distribution of wasp diversity and then revealed the relationship between the wasp diversity and the functional zoning in the Nanling subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest. Our study provides a scientific basis for the long-term monitoring and conservation management of insect biodiversity in protected areas. © 2023, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are necessary to allow habitat recovery and fish stock replenishment. Through the United States Agency for International Development Sustainable Ecosystems Advanced Project (2016–2021), Indonesia worked to improve fisheries productivity and sustainable livelihoods within the three provinces of Maluku, North Maluku and West Papua, where 13 new coral reef MPAs were designed for multiple use, with a zoning system to support biodiversity conservation and sustainable fisheries. At the time of writing in mid-2021, regulations to prohibit fishing within the no-take areas (NTAs) were not yet implemented. This paper presents baseline and trends in percent coral cover and reef fish density and biomass in the MPAs. In 2020, overall coral cover had increased from 42% to 45% across all MPAs. The average target fish biomass across all NTAs had declined from 1709 ( ± 176 SE) kg per hectare in 2017 to 884 ( ± 76 SE) kg per hectare in 2020, representing a significant decline of about 48%. Large and significant declines in many target fish families across multiple MPAs are reflective of unsustainable levels of exploitation. It is evident that management plans need to be implemented with adequate enforcement and stakeholder engagement to stem the decline of target species and to secure livelihoods for local fishing communities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Coral triangle; Marine tourism; Overfishing; Sustainability","Indonesia; Maluku [Indonesia]; North Maluku; West Papua; climate change; coastal zone management; conservation; coral reef; fishing community; overfishing; protected area; sustainability; tourism; trend analysis; zoning system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131646276"

In particular, regional and urban planning processes should adequately manage, improve and monitor the effectiveness of green infrastructures as ecological networks which provide ecosystem services and the spatial connectivity of such systems. Building on a methodological approach defined in previous studies, this article aims at identifying ecological corridors through a least-cost path model with reference to the spatial layout of a set of protected areas. Moreover, such a methodological approach is implemented in the context of the Sardinian region to map ecological corridors, which form, together with protected areas, a network representing the spatial framework of regional green infrastructure. Finally, the study discusses the relation between ecological corridors and the spatial taxonomy of the landscape components featured by environmental relevance, identified by the Regional Landscape Plan, through multiple linear regression analysis, in order to assess if, and to what extent, the present regional spatial zoning code can be used as a basis to im-plement regulations aimed at protecting ecological corridors. This methodological approach is relevant to defining planning policies and measures to strengthen the operational capacity and effectiveness of regional networks of protected areas through the protection and the improvement of the spatial framework of ecological corridors. © 2022 by the authors.

It is necessary to develop scientific land-use management strategies in the Three-River Headwaters Region to achieve the goal of sustainable land development. This study selected six vital ecosystem services (ESs) for the study area namely, water supply, carbon sequestration, soil retention, sand fixation, hydrological regulation, and flood mitigation to quantify and map the spatiotemporal distributions of these ecosystem services during 2000–2018. We also mapped the spatial distribution of biodiversity protection importance in the Three-River Headwaters Region using the MaxEnt model. We further identified the priority conservation areas through the combination of biodiversity and six ecosystem services with different area thresholds and compared the conservation efficiencies in the Sanjiangyuan National Park and the current protected areas in the Three-River Headwaters Region. In addition, we evaluated the relationships between ecosystem services and biodiversity protection importance and the impacts of eleven environmental factors (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index, elevation, slope, temperature, precipitation; wind speed, solar radiation, the proportion of forest land, the proportion of grassland, the proportion of cropland, and the proportion of wetland) on them. Finally, we identified the functional zones based on the ecosystem services-biodiversity bundles and proposed the corresponding management schemes. The results showed that the spatial distributions of six ecosystem services and biodiversity protection importance in the Three-River Headwaters Region were not spatially congruent. With the changes in the area thresholds in extracting priority conservation areas, the protection focus in the Sanjiangyuan National Park and the current protected areas should be updated accordingly. We identified eight ecosystem services-biodiversity bundles in the Three-River Headwaters Region and divided them into five ecological functional zones, based on which then the corresponding zoning optimization management schemes in each bundle and function zone were proposed. Comprehensive consideration of ecosystem services and biodiversity protection importance is insightful for other regions to conserve biodiversity and exploit natural resources simultaneously. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity protection; Ecological security; Ecosystem service; Priority conservation area; Three-river headwaters region","Conservation; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Land use; Rivers; Slope protection; Spatial distribution; Water supply; Wind; 'current; Area threshold; Biodiversity protection; Conservation areas; Ecological security; Ecosystem services; National parks; Priority conservation area; Service protections; Three-rivers headwater regions; Biodiversity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129961405"

The Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 aims to address this situation by expanding the network of protected areas (PAs) and enhancing their effectiveness. However, many PAs still lack management plans, which in the case of the Natura 2000 network need to harmonise nature conservation and human uses objectives. We demonstrate how to use a spatial optimisation tool to design a multi-zoning scheme and to spatially direct management actions across the PA that address the Natura 2000 network needs. We integrate distributions of species, habitats and human activities (features) to prioritise the allocation of three management zones within a PA, using the Montseny Natural Park (NE Spain) for demonstration purposes. We also evaluate potential trade-offs between nature conservation and human uses by increasing representation targets for human uses while maintaining biodiversity targets constant. We found little representation trade-offs as targets were achieved (92%) for most of features regardless the representation target for human uses tested. However, we found spatial trade-offs as management zones became more fragmented for large targets on human uses, making the potential implementation of these solutions less feasible and/or effective. This methodology could be useful at addressing the multiple objectives pursued when designing management plans in PAs like Natura 2000 sites. Key aspects that deserve special attention are (i) the need for careful evaluation of the relationships between objectives to identify potential trade-offs and co-benefits and (ii) the designation of management zones were these relationships can be addressed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Conservation planning; Marxan with Zones; Montseny; Natura 2000 network; Trade-offs","biodiversity; conservation management; conservation planning; nature conservation; protected area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125240077"

This study examined whether assemblages of fishes differed between partially closed (PC) estuaries that permit recreational fishing compared to fully fished (FF) estuaries that permit commercial and recreational fisheries. Fish assemblages were quantitatively sampled in a standard and stratified manner using a multimesh gillnet and beam trawl that sampled different ichthyofaunal components in two PC and two FF estuaries across three years, ∼ six to eight years post commercial fishing closure and PC implementation. There was no global support for the hypothesis that assemblages, diversity and numbers of fishes would differ between PC and FF estuaries. Assemblages significantly and consistently differed among individual estuaries regardless of estuary management category. Differences between PC and FF estuaries in terms of numbers of species and individuals were inconsistent across years, with more species (gillnet) and individuals (trawl) occurring in PC estuaries in only one of three years. Only one species (Gerres subfasciatus) was more abundant (gillnet) in the PC category, most likely due to reduced fishery harvests. In contrast, juveniles of three harvested species (G. subfasciatus, Rhabdosargus sarba and Acanthopagrus spp.) occurred in greater numbers (trawl) in FF estuaries, potentially a result of strong recruitment and estuary-specific environmental conditions.

The national park is being developed in accordance with the environmental legislation provided for economic activities within such protected areas. The purpose of the creation of the national park was the need to preserve the diversity of landscapes of the Tunkinsky mountain valley and the mountain ranges surrounding it, the protection of biodiversity, natural, historical and cultural monuments in combination with tourism. The regulation of the use of the park territory is carried out in accordance with its functional zoning for environmental education, scientific, recreational and limited economic purposes. The study area has long been a place of traditional use of natural resources. Here people hunted, fished, grazed cattle, gathered wild plants, people settled along the banks of lakes and rivers. In the Soviet years, this area received intensive recreational development due to active tourist development, which was facilitated by good transport accessibility and the existing settlement infrastructure. A sociological survey, as well as conversations in local administration bodies, showed that such types of economic activity as agriculture, cattle breeding, recreation (serving tourists), gathering, crafts, etc. remain the main ones in the livelihood of the local population. All these forms of economic activity affect nature in different ways, transform it. The practical significance of the research lies in the possibility of using the results of the study by various organizations, including administrative bodies of any level, to assess the current socio-economic situation and forecast its development, to prevent conflicts in nature resource management, to make effective decisions in management, choosing strategies for the possible development of the territory. © 2022 Lomonosov Moscow State University.

It was found that highly sensitive areas existed primarily in the highlands, where the natural conditions were poorer than in other areas and human activities have been developing rapidly. Additionally, the medium sensitive levels occurred in the low lands, probably in response to agricultural practices.

Nature protection can help conserve biodiversity, but increasing wildlife numbers inside protected areas and shrinking habitats intensify interactions between humans and wildlife, potentially causing human–wildlife conflict (HWC). Contemporary narratives of HWC highlight detrimental effects on households' socioeconomic outcomes. Despite a wealth of literature on HWC, many studies remain descriptive and little inferential evidence has been provided. Here we identify the determinants and effects of reported HWC on household outcomes using spatial predictors and an original farm-household dataset collected in Namibia's share of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. In addition to dependence on agriculture, we find that community-based conservation, the share of a community's area set aside for conservation, and habitat connectivity are key drivers of HWC. Contrary to contemporary narratives of HWC, we find that reported conflicts did not have strong negative effects on household income and livelihood diversity. Conversely, community-based wildlife conservation increases income and livelihood diversity among participating households. It is, however, also associated with food insecurity concerns. Such concerns may be driven by comparatively higher restrictions related to land use planning and zoning that constrain productive land uses, such as agriculture. Our findings suggest that community-based conservation can create development synergies for households in favorable environments, despite increasing HWC risks.

Quantifying and mitigating conflicts and impact on sensitive coastal environments through jointly-optimized objectives for aquaculture and biodiversity simultaneously has not been tested yet. We here develop and evaluate six alternative planning scenarios for one of the European Union's highest priority bivalve shellfish aquaculture areas, the Emilia-Romagna Region in Italy. We i) develop an aquaculture profitability surface as a function of the distance from main ports, and in parallel build a fine-scale aquaculture suitability distribution surface for important commercial species using multi-criteria analysis; ii) prioritize protected areas for biodiversity while testing how different considerations of human impacts influence priorities; iii) simultaneously plan for aquaculture and biodiversity while minimizing impacts on other maritime activities. We compare results from different scenarios according to how well they capture suitable aquaculture habitats and minimize impacts. We introduce a new evaluation method for scenario comparison in spatial optimization using a nearest-neighbor analysis for spatial pattern similarities. Lastly, we test the “value of information” provided by our investment in developing the fine-scale suitability surface to improve efficiencies. We find that an integrated multi-objective zoning approach, which simultaneously optimizes for biodiversity and aquaculture, supports more efficient planning than traditional sector specific growth strategies. We also discovered that the fine-scale suitability model delivered a 5% more efficient solution than the simple distance function, highlighting the role of proxy cost surfaces and diminished returns from investing in comprehensive habitat suitability analysis in regions without much variation in key parameters. We offer evidence of improved efficiency and practical guidance for integrated planning in Blue Growth agendas. Our analysis can be applied in any context where multiple objectives occur for aquaculture sector growth and biodiversity conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity conservation; Maritime spatial planning; Marxan and Marxan with zones; Multi-objective zoning; Sustainable aquaculture development; Value of information","Aquaculture; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Italy; Bivalvia; Emilia; Aquaculture; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Environmental protection; Function evaluation; Investments; Planning; Zoning; Biodiversity conservation; Fine-scale; Food production; Maritime spatial planning; Marxan and marxan with zone; Multi objective; Multi-objective zoning; Production industries; Sustainable aquaculture development; Value of information; anthropogenic effect; aquaculture; biodiversity; conservation planning; food production; habitat conservation; human activity; marine environment; scenario analysis; spatial planning; sustainable development; zoning system; article; bivalve; commercial species; conservation biology; European Union; habitat; human; human impact (environment); intermethod comparison; investment; Italy; nonhuman; shellfish farming; aquaculture; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental protection; Conservation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104924158"

Munseom MPA has a unique underwater landscape including soft coral, subtropical fish, and benthos, attracting many scuba divers. This paper intends to evaluate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the scuba diving management policy in the Munseom MPA. As a stated preference valuation method, a choice experiment was applied to assess divers’ preferences with economic values for the policy. The attributes used in the study included zoning (temporal closure), conservation education, daily permit, soft coral area, and diving fee. We collected 333 questionnaires through online and field surveys and used 296 after excluding incomplete responses for the final data analysis. Study results show that a six-month closure, a decrease in soft coral habitat, and the diving fee were statistically significant. A positive coefficient with regard to the six-month closure variable indicates that divers preferred the policy, and the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) was estimated to be KRW 8,637 per person per dive. The aggregate WTP of KRW 233 million was obtained by multiplying the MWTP by the number of visiting divers per year. When comparing the levels of recreation specialization, more skilled divers preferred the management option. The results of this study will help predict the priority of management measures and the levels of acceptability among divers when diving management is implemented in Korea in the future. This study suggests that marine environmental policies need to consider divers as one of the important stakeholders for marine conservation. © 2022 Ocean and Polar Research.","choice experiment; marine protected area; Munseom; soft coral habitat; zoning","South Korea; experiment; management; protected area; scuba diving; soft coral; willingness to pay; zoning system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139136104"

The study selected Liyang City as a case of the humid hilly area of Southeast China, listed the ecological assets, and put forward zoning and management strategies according to the spatial distribution of ecological asset value. Multiple ecosystem services (i.e., water conservation, water purification, biodiversity protection, recreational service and product supply services) were quantified and mapped by integrated InVEST model, Market Value Method and Replacement Cost Method. Results showed that the total ecological assets of Liyang City were valued to about 310.59 billion Yuan, with per unit area value of 2.45 million Yuan /hm2 through the Net Present Value Method. Comparing with biodiversity protection and water purification, the value of recreational service, product supply services and water conservation have a greater contribution to the total value of ecological assets. The study found that tangible ecological assets and intangible ecological assets have significantly varied spatial distribution. There are lots of repetitive regions between high-value areas of water conservation, recreational service, water purification and biodiversity protection, which are mainly composed of forests, indicating Liyang made the utmost of natural resource endowments to realize the transformation of ecological resource value. As the important carriers of ecological asset value, the total value of ecological assets in water bodies and woodland are larger than other land-use types. According to the distribution of ecological asset value, different grades of ecological asset value in Liyang City were obtained. High-value areas are mainly composed of woodland and the water bodies in hilly areas, which are the key protected areas in Liyang City, while low-value areas are mainly consisted of cultivated land and attention should be paid to the trade-off and synergy relationships among different ecological asset values in cultivated land and garden land. The study of valuation and ecological zoning of ecological assets in Liyang City had important theoretical and practical significance of promoting the harmonious coexistence between man and nature in Liyang City and constructing the national territory development and protection pattern. © 2022, Science Press.

Better functional zoning is of great significance to the protection of ecosystem legitimacy and integrity, the appropriate utilization of resources, community integration, and feasible management. In the present study, the proposed Qinghai Lake National Park is the research object. Based on the critical goal of ecological protection, the importance of ecosystem service functions and the ecological sensitivities were evaluated. The results showed that the ecosystem service functions and the ecological sensitivity of the whole region are high. Among them, lake, river and wetland as the most strictly protected ecosystems account for the highest proportion. Then this study divided the proposed Qinghai Lake National Park into five functional areas through grid calculations, spatial analysis and multifactor trade-off. The results indicated that the goal of functional zoning for national park is to maximize the overall utility of park protection value and its comprehensive functions based on its spatial units with different functions, management and control requirements. The zoning scheme addresses the lack of sustainable development in Qinghai Lake National Park due to ecological environmental changes and single-resource zoning with resource protection as the primary goal.

However, to promote the coordinated development of economic construction and ecological protection of protected areas, their management needs to be more comprehensive and refined. Therefore, a more quantitative and refined spatial planning and management method for protected areas is urgently needed. This study took Sanjiangyuan National Park as the research object and considered the three biodiversity elements of species, ecosystems and landscape. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, and Fragstats software were used to determine the areas with highly suitable species habitat, areas of high ecosystem service value and areas of high landscape diversity. Based on these areas, Marxan software was used to calculate the irreplaceability value, identify the boundary of Sanjiangyuan National Park and clarify the gaps of the existing Sanjiangyuan National Park in the space. We suggest that at least 18,569 km2 of the eastern part of the Sanjiangyuan Region with a high irreplaceability value should be included in the existing Sanjiangyuan National Park. Moreover, the first-level zones were also classified based on irreplaceability, and the second-level functional zones were classified by K-means clustering based on the evaluation of ecological vulnerability and economic construction suitability. The first-level zones include “core conservation zones” and “general control zones”, which had areas of 71,758.20 km2 (57.99%) and 51,980.13 km2 (42.01%), respectively. The core conservation zones were further zoned into primary vulnerable zones and secondary vulnerable zones. The subzones of the general control zones are multifunctional and they are tourism-grazing-living zones, grazing-living zones, tourism-living zones, tourism zones and other areas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Boundary delineation; Ecosystem services; Landscape diversity; Sanjiangyuan National Park; Species habitat suitability; Zoning","Biodiversity; China; City Planning; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Parks, Recreational; China; Qinghai; Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Grading; K-means clustering; Maximum entropy methods; Site selection; Zoning; Boundary delineation; Classifieds; Economic constructions; Ecosystem services; Habitat suitability; Landscape diversity; National parks; Protected areas; Sanjiangyuan national park; Species habitat suitability; biodiversity; conservation; ecosystem service; environmental policy; functional group; habitat quality; landscape structure; maximum entropy analysis; national park; protected area; software; zoning system; article; biodiversity; ecosystem; ecosystem service value; ecosystem vulnerability; grazing; k means clustering; landscape; maximum entropy model; national park; software; species habitat; tourism; biodiversity; China; city planning; ecosystem; environmental protection; procedures; recreational park; Environmental protection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125447867"

Free open-source softwares QGIS and InveST, open-access spatial data were used. Crucial negative transformations and predominance of negative zoning areas with too mild nature protection regimes have been revealed: landscape metrics indices rise (some of them more than doubled, especially coefficient of ideal form), exclusion of some PA part and its compensations with valley parts that are lie further away from main PA part, average-weighted ecosystem potentials difference estimated in two ways is -4.8 (possible values range from -20 to +20), reduction of zones with strict nature protection restrictions from 35% to 11%. Growth of recreational potential and construction of large transport objects are the crucial causes of current negative changes in case-study reserve at the same time, construction of engineering, social and administrative facilities are the secondary causes.

NPs were mainly created to preserve the landscape-forming biotopes. Siberian and Far Eastern NPs were founded in the late 1980s or early 1990s. As a result, previously human-populated or otherwise affected areas that contained settlements, logging sites, mining sites, collective farms, and other economic facilities were transformed into national parks. A national park is supposed to provide venue for research and recreation, which is at odds with the locals' economic activities. Irrational recreational use of NP areas degrades the plant communities: Vulnerable species vanish, less vulnerable replace them, and meadow species become widespread in forest ecosystems; it also negatively affects the soil cover as it destroys the ground litter of soils, makes the humus horizon shallow and too dense, ultimately killing the soil microflora. This is the case of nearly any NP in Siberia and the Far East, which calls for well-thought-out economic zoning of areas that would be environmentally, economically, and legally sound. It is on this basis that this paper proposes a socioeconomic development concept (the Concept) for the Tunkinsky NP. © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Biodiversity; Conservation; Economics; Ecosystems; Forestry; Plants (botany); Soils; Anthropogenic impacts; Economic activities; Forest ecosystem; Natural environments; Plant communities; Protected areas; Socio-economic development; Soil microflora; Economic and social effects","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102749671"

Despite its global popularity, however, human use zoning generates problems such as the separation of compatible uses and consequent user conflict (e.g., researchers and ecotourists). It allocates more resources to manage human uses than to biophysical conditions that protected areas are charged to conserve. It reduces manifestations of the same use (e.g., intensive and small-scale agriculture) into just one scale of impact. It uses objective criteria to define zones in situations where subjective values may conflict. In response, alternative zoning schemes have emerged, among them, resource condition-based approaches. These, however, tend to be highly technical, poorly evaluated, and show little evidence of adoption by protected area systems, especially in developing countries. This paper therefore proposes a condition-based approach that addresses these weaknesses by using pre-defined conservation targets as the principal criteria to define zones, thus clearly linking conservation planning (such as the Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation) and management zoning. Condition-based zoning focuses on strategic conservation actions with the use of conditions, indicators, standards, and corresponding preventative and corrective management actions, rather than being prescriptive and punitive as with the human use zoning model. Furthermore, the article proposes technology and methodology that are more appropriate for the technical capacity of developing countries. It also traces the development of condition-based zoning from early urban zoning and presents a pilot application in Costa Rica’s Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve. © 2021, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a widely adopted management tool to address these challenges, but their conservation effectiveness is uncertain, especially in developing countries such as China. Management effectiveness evaluation (MEE) is an efficient method for assessing MPA outcomes and identifying key impact factors. However, only a limited number of MEEs have been conducted for China's MPAs in the past two decades, thus largely limiting their improvement of management. In this context, we conducted a comprehensive review of MPAs status and existing MEEs in China. We found that despite the significant increase in the number and coverage of China's MPAs, their conservation effectiveness might be impacted by the lack of systematic planning, adequate funding, appropriate zoning, long-term monitoring, and sound laws. Major challenges to the evaluation of MPA management effectiveness in China include the lack of a standardized framework, limited survey data, financial support, and public engagement. To address these challenges, we developed a comprehensive framework based on the common objectives of China's MPAs and existing MEE frameworks. We also recommend based on the developed framework: 1) establishing long-term monitoring pilots in national MPAs; 2) providing sustained funding support for MEE, monitoring and capacity building from government, social capital, and ecotourism; and 3) promoting public participation in MPA management and evaluation through advocacy, incentive mechanisms, and establishment of committees. Adopting our recommendations can strengthen adaptive management and provide new insights into evidence-based decision-making for MPAs in China. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive strategies; Challenges; China; Evaluation framework; Management effectiveness; Marine protected areas","China; Conservation; Decision making; Developing countries; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Population statistics; Adaptive strategy; Challenge; China; Conservation effectiveness; Effectiveness evaluation; Evaluation framework; Long term monitoring; Management effectiveness; Marine protected area; Protected area management; adaptive management; conservation management; conservation planning; decision making; developing world; local participation; management practice; marine ecosystem; marine park; participatory approach; population growth; strategic approach; Finance","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128196139"

This study examined whether the relative abundances and length and age characteristics of five harvested species of fish differed between recreational-only fished (ROF) estuaries, and those open to both recreational and commercial fishing (non-ROF) in southeastern Australia. Specific predictions based on absolute and ranked values of a range of parameters were made so that conclusions could be reached about the effects of management. Fish were sampled using multimesh gillnets in a standard and stratified manner across two ROF and two non-ROF estuaries over three years, six to eight years post ROF implementation. Abundances of each species fluctuated among individual estuaries and sampling times with no indication of greater abundances in ROF estuaries. For four species (Sillago ciliata, Mugil cephalus, Acanthopagrus spp. and Girella tricuspidata), the mean lengths and the proportions of individuals of legal length, were mostly greater in the ROF compared to the non-ROF estuaries. However, for Platycephalus fuscus there were no discernible patterns. Three species (P. fuscus, S. ciliata and Acanthopagrus spp.) had a significantly greater proportion of older fish in the ROF estuaries, but for M. cephalus and G. tricuspidata this was only evident in one ROF estuary. It is hypothesised that the cessation of commercial fishing and subsequent reduction in fishing pressure in the ROF estuaries allowed a greater proportion of individuals of each species to survive to become larger and older. This study provides correlative evidence that ROF estuaries can protect some harvested species at the local scale of estuary. Examination of lengths and ages of fish, rather than simply their abundances, was necessary to identify the effects of removing commercial fishing. Further research is required to determine the potential broader-scale and long-term sustainability benefits on species as well as any spill-over effects on other organisms and estuarine ecosystems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Estuary zoning; Fisheries sustainability; Fishery-independent survey; Management evaluation; Partially protected area; Recreational fishing","Australia; angling; estuarine environment; fishery management; protected area; relative abundance; spatial analysis; species conservation; sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135838814"

Scientifically, it is necessary to construct an ecological landscape pattern on the basis of ecological security evaluation. This paper selected evaluation factors based on the perspective of “environmental base and human interference”, used spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) to comprehensively evaluate the regional landscape ecological security, and used the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model to construct the regional ecological security pattern. The results show that the overall ecological security level of the study area is low, and the area with a moderate safety level and below is 122,100 km2, accounting for 72.57% of the total area of the study area. The total area of the identified ecological source area is 6683 km2, the spatial distribution is extremely uneven, and it is extremely concentrated in the southern region; 32 ecological corridors with a total length of 3817.8 km are identified, of which corridor NO. 1–4 run through the Qilian Mountains, 11 oasis areas, and 14 nature reserves. The length of ecological corridors is 1376.1 km, accounting for 36.04% of the total. Forty-two ecological nodes are identified, and the central corridor area is more distributed; four ecological restoration zones are divided, including an ecological conservation zone, ecological improvement zone, ecological control zone, and ecological restoration zone, with areas of 34,380.3 km2, 61,884.4 km2, 21,134.4 km2, and 50,648.3 km2, respectively. Through the delineation of the urban ecological network pattern composed of source areas, corridors, and nodes, as well as the delineation of ecological restoration zones, the ecological security level of the study area will be effectively improved. Furthermore, a new method of ecological restoration zoning will be used, hoping to provide a useful reference for improving the quality of the ecological environment in arid areas and optimizing the spatial pattern of the land. © 2021 by the authors.

Vegetation structure, food availability, and human activity often are used to guide conservation efforts, such as protected area zoning and reforestation, especially for primates. We sought to determine whether Critically Endangered golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli) densities could be predicted across a heterogeneous landscape as a function of vegetation structure, food availability, and human activity. We conducted walking transect surveys across the sifakas’ entire global range in Loky-Manambato Protected Area of Madagascar from 2016–2018, expanding upon a study conducted in 2006/2008. Potential predictors of sifaka density included metrics of vegetation structure (e.g., tree density, forest type), food availability (e.g., food tree basal area, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), and human activity (e.g., tree cutting, livestock grazing). Low-intensity tree cutting and wet season NDVI were the best, positive predictors of sifaka densities. Sifaka densities within study units across their restricted range (880 km2) were highly variable (range: 6.8–78.1 sifakas/km2), emphasizing the importance of large-scale study designs across all suitable land cover types for assessing a species’ abundance, regardless of its area of occupancy. We estimated that 10,222–12,631 sifakas remain. Based on previous surveys, this indicates that populations either remained stable over the past 20 years or have declined by 30–43% in the past 10 years; we argue that a decline is most likely based on our updating of forest cover estimates for both of the prior studies. We also found that wet season NDVI is a positive predictor of sifaka densities, which will aid managers in prioritizing conservation actions in this region using widely available remotely sensed data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Abundance; Golden-crowned sifaka; Lemur; Madagascar; NDVI; Primate","Madagascar; abundance; endangered species; food availability; forest cover; land cover; livestock; NDVI; primate; protected area; vegetation index; vegetation structure; walking; wet season; zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135973786"

The various aspects of the green economy and green development identified by them, including geographical, economic, social, and environmental ones, as well as their interconnections, are given. Green development is the economic development or development of a certain territory in which technogenic and anthropogenic impacts on the environment are minimized and the biodiversity of its landscapes and, in general, its green vegetation is preserved. It is suggested that green development should be treated as the first stages in achieving sustainable development. In order to implement certain incentives and governance, it is proposed to identify territories for green development. It is thought that one of their most important components is the existence of specially protected natural areas and their combinations, such as nature reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, protected areas, and significant areas of wildlife. A green economy should become predominant, ensuring a rise in production with a reduction in energy consumption and an improvement of the standard of living with reductions in resources used and technogenic pressure on ecosystems and biodiversity. Taking into consideration these criteria, as well as approaches to the natural and economic zoning on the territory of Primorskii krai, five territories (zones) were identified that hold promise for green development. The characteristic of the natural resource potential of the selected territories and of their existing specialization is provided, and the priority types of economic activities that are compatible with green development are determined. The establishment of a special status (“territory of green development”) is suggested. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","green economy; natural and economic areas; Primorskii krai; specially protected natural areas; sustainable development; wildlife","Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Rome; economic development; green economy; living standard; natural resource; protected area; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; wild population","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143526745"

The dynamics of zoning of the Losiny Ostrov National Park from 1988 to 2012 was assessed from the position of environmental regimes using open-access data. Using GIS technologies, the estimated dynamic schemes of environmental restrictions were obtained. The tendency to easing regulations clearly exists: the weighted average dynamic parameter of environmental value is –3.27 (possible values vary from –20 to 20). The 2012 version established stronger transformations of environmental restrictions than in 2010 (dynamic indicators are –0.62 and –2.65, respectively). The greatest negative changes for natural complexes are associated with the allocation of a historical and cultural zone, the transformation of third-party user sites into economic zones, the expansion of the recreational zone, and the disappearance of the educational and excursion zone. Differences between Moscow city and the adjacent Moscow region are negligible. However, there is considerable disparity between current zoning of urban and regional parts of the park (restriction indicators are 7.41 and 12.17, respectively). Urban space is more oriented towards recreation, indicating an incompatibility with the status of a national park. In contrast to the outer 1000-meter belt, the central part of the park has had greater deterioration of nature restrictions. The weighted average indicator of ecosystem compliance (environmental restrictions and vulnerability of natural complexes) is 3.3 (possible values range from –20 to 20), which points to a sufficient level of compliance with the functional zoning of landscape vulnerability. This accordance is more typical of inner part of the park inner and territories within the boundary of Moscow. © 2022 St. Petersburg University Press.

However, human activities, limited territorial planning, and unsustainable demand and consumption of natural goods and services put pressure on marine-coastal ecosystems. In this sense, marine-coastal planning is a management tool to contrast these forces because it manages different human activities on the coast and in the oceans over space and time, strengthening political, social, and tourist development and the economy of the territory. Our objective is to propose marine-coastal spatial planning strategies through an ecosystem-based approach for allocating a mangrove and estuarine zone conservation area. The study methodology is: (i) Compilation of information from the study area with an emphasis on regulations and protected areas. (ii) Analysis of human relations with marine-coastal ecosystems.

The growing concern about habitat loss has spurred China's national park project to shift from pilot to construction phase with the official establishment of China's first group of national parks (CFGNPs) in October 2021. But far too little attention has been paid to the synergistic work concerning the habitat quality (HQ) dynamics of all five national parks. Here, the InVEST model, combined with a satellite-derived land use and land cover product and a hot spot analysis (HSA) method, was used to investigate the HQ dynamics at the park- and pixel-scale within the CFGNPs. Our results demonstrate that the past ecological conservation practices within national parks have been unpromising, especially in Giant Panda National Park, Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park (NCTL), and Wuyi Mountain National Park (WYM), where HQ as a whole showed a significant decline. Furthermore, more than half of Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park (87.2%), WYM (77.4%), and NCTL (52.9%) showed significant HQ degradation from 1980 to 2019. Besides, increasing trends in the area shares of HQ degraded pixels were observed in all five national parks from 1980–1999 to 2000–2019. The HSA implied that the hot spots of high HQ degradation rates tend to occur in areas closer to urban settlements or on the edge of national parks, where human activities are intensive. Despite these disappointing findings, we highlighted from the observed local successes and the HQ plateau that the construction of CFGNPs is expected to reverse the deteriorating HQ trends. Thus, we concluded our paper by proposing an HSA-based regulatory zoning scheme that includes five subzones to guide the future construction of China's national park system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Habitat quality; Hot spot analysis; InVEST; Land use and land cover; National parks; Protected areas","Biodiversity; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Humans; Parks, Recreational; China; Hainan; conservation status; habitat loss; habitat quality; land cover; land use; national park; spatiotemporal analysis; article; China; giant panda; habitat quality; human; land use; leopard; mountain; national park; nonhuman; tiger; tropical rain forest; biodiversity; China; ecosystem; environmental protection; procedures; recreational park","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140139518"

In order to create protected areas, the issue of area management is discussed and zoning in the management of parks and protected areas is a solution to reduce conflicts in protected area management and it provides the opportunity to take the necessary measures. Lar National Park with an area of 28037 ha is located in 70 km of northeast of Tehran. This area with the aim of protecting 28 species of mammals, 105 species of birds, 23 species of reptiles and several species of fish has been managed; while this region receives a population of nomads every year, who use the pastures of the regions for grazing in a period of one hundred days. To prepare a conservation management plan, the ecological resources of the region were mapped and overlaid to achieve management units. These units were investigated for restricted nature, protected, restoration, recreational and special zones in the area. After determination of social economic conditions of native people, a management plan was defined for the region. The planning defined public participation, staff training, ecological and socio economic impacts assessment and monitoring program in Lar National Park. Findings revealed that Lar National Park has an important role in preserving the nature and species of the region based on the evaluation. Therefore, for the protection and promotion of habitats and species, it has required conscious and active intervention and a coherent management plan for the region should be considered. Conservation of hotspot biodiversity areas ensures that other human activities do not harm these areas, and the reliability and viability of areas with higher conservation values over an indefinite period of time is ensured. The study proved that the zoning process is a decision-making issue that inherently requires the evaluation of different land features based on multiple objectives. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Decision-making; National park; Protected area; Zonning","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108674746"

Ecosystem service bundles and trade-offs can identify interactions among multiple ecosystem services, and achieve better social-ecosystem management when applying to ecological function zoning. Taking the Dongjiang Lake Basin, China, as research area, the study used the InVEST model to investigate the trade-offs and synergies of ecosystem services at township and grid scales, respectively. Then, the study conducted ecological function zoning based on the bundles and trade-off intensity among ecosystem services. The results showed that food production showed extremely significant trade-offs with other services in the two scales, in which the trade-off intensity between food production and water purification was the largest, and the water areas were the hotspots of trade-off intensity. Based on the ecosystem service bundles at the township, combined with the trade-off intensity, the watershed was finally divided into four ecological functional zones, namely, agricultural product supply area (southern part in the study area), economic forestry area (northeast regions in the study area), water supply area (western areas of the study area), and forest conservation area (northern areas in the study area), accounting for 29.27%, 14.63%, 17.07%, and 39.03%, respectively. The study contributed to the ecological function maintenance and sustainable development in Dongjiang Lake Basin and provided an important reference in ecological zoning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Dongjiang Lake Basin; Ecological functional zoning; Ecosystem service bundles; Trade-offs","Agriculture; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Lakes; Sustainable Development; China; ecosystem service; food production; forestry; protected area; purification; sustainable development; water supply; watershed; zoning; agriculture; China; ecosystem; environmental protection; lake; sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145838392"

Wild boars are generally considered to exhibit substantial behavioral flexibility, but it is unclear how their behavior varies across different conservation management regimes and levels of human pressure. To analyze if and how wild boars adjust their space use or their temporal niche, we surveyed wild boars across the core and buffer zones (collectively referred to as the conservation zone) and the transition zone of a biosphere reserve. These zones represent low and high levels of human pressure, respectively. Specifically, we employed a network of 53 camera traps distributed in the Schaalsee UNESCO Biosphere Reserve over a 14-month period (19,062 trap nights) and estimated circadian activity patterns, diel activity levels, and occupancy of wild boars in both zones. To account for differences in environmental conditions and day length, we estimated these parameters separately for seven 2-month periods. Our results showed that the wild boars were primarily nocturnal, with diurnal activity occurring dominantly during the summer months. The diel activity patterns in the two zones were very similar overall, although the wild boars were slightly less active in the transition zone than in the conservation zone. Diel activity levels also varied seasonally, ranging from 7.5 to 11.0 h day−1, and scaled positively with the length of the night (R2 = 0.66–0.67). Seasonal occupancy estimates were exceptionally high (point estimates ranged from 0.65 to 0.99) and similar across zones, suggesting that the wild boars used most of the biosphere reserve. Overall, this result suggests that different conservation management regimes (in this case, the zoning of a biosphere reserve) have little impact on wild boar behavior. This finding is relevant for wildlife management in protected areas where possibly high wild boar densities could interfere with conservation goals within these areas and those of agricultural land use in their vicinity. © 2021 The Authors.

It is the most important West-East geo-ecological space in China, containing protected areas vital for biodiversity conservation and ecological security of China. The protection and rational development of its natural habitat is of great significance to China’s ecological security and integration of protected areas based on mountain forest ecosystems on a global scale. In this study, five important types of protected areas in the transitional zone were selected, and their spatial patterns were analysed. Spatial analysis methods, such as kernel density estimation and accessibility analysis, were employed for both point and areal data, and focused on four aspects: land use scale, shift in the centre of gravity, spatial agglomeration, and accessibility. In addition, policy background and evolution of spatial and temporal characteristics of the protected area system in the transitional zone from 1963 to 2017 were also examined. We analysed the characteristics and geographical significance of the West-east corridor using the spatial pattern of the protected area system from the perspective of ecological and economic spaces. We focused on spatial shape, type intersection, and key areas to analyse the spatial overlap of the protected areas. Protected area establishment was divided into three stages: initial (1956–1980), rapid development (1981–2013), and national park transformation (2014—present). These stages reflected the change in the concept of ‘simple protection—sustainable use—integration and upgrade’ for protected areas of China. The spatial centre of gravity of the protection zone system was located in the west Qinling-Daba Mountains, and its high-density core exhibited a relatively stable N-shaped structure composed of four gathering areas. Affected by factors such as geographic environment and socio-economic development density, the average access time for protected areas was high (1.56 h); wetland parks and scenic areas are located closer to the city centre. As the West-east corridor in the transitional zone extends from west to east, there is a clear spatial dislocation between the development of protected areas and the intensity of human activities. During development, differentiated goal orientation should be adopted based on the idea of zoning and classified governance. With the advancement of the construction of protected areas, the spatial overlap of protected areas in the transition zone has become more prominent. At present, the spatially overlapped protected areas in the transitional zone remain prominent, with inclusion overlap being the most common, and forest parks exhibiting the highest probability of overlap with other protected areas, we should focus on in the integration process of the corridor-type ecological space based on the mountain forest ecosystem. © 2021, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","accessibility; North-south Transitional Zone (NSTZ); protected area (PA); spatial overlap; spatial-temporal pattern; the West-east corridor","China; Daba Mountains; Qinling Mountains; accessibility; policy approach; protected area; spatial analysis; temporal analysis; transition zone","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096837377"

To understand the current status of China’s ecological conservation redline strategy and its major implementing area, i.e. protected areas, we collected and comprehensively analyzed the policies and literature regarding the topics of ecological conservation redline and PA governance. Results: (1) As a part of ecological conservation redline areas, PA’s delineation and zoning is not only a single natural scientific issue, but also a multi-objective; (2) The ecological conservation redline is not only a static physical space line but also a baseline for the dynamic control of the ecosystem; (3) Under the scope of ecological conservation redline strategy, PA’s delineation and zoning needs to consider geographical differentiation and should be based on local and time-based policies. Conclusion: The handling of the human‒land relationship within ecological conservation redline needs to clarify the development permission of PAs and scientifically concession uses of natural resources. The ecosystem characteristics of PAs should be studied to fully demonstrate their ability to withstand human activities under the premise of conserving the natural ecology. In this way, human activities will ultimately be controlled within the acceptable “baseline” of the stability of the ecosystem. © 2022, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In Iran, the application of landscape structure studies in protection policies and PA management is not prevalent. In this study, land cover changes in Dena Rural District (including parts of inside and outside Dena PA) have analyzed using the process of the Landsat images along with field survey two times (1989 and 2018). The landscape structural integrity was quantified based on the situation of oak forest land and its alteration. The composition and the configuration of oak forest land were assessed by metrics based on the moving extent of the Persian squirrel, Sciurus anomalus (which is an endangered focal endemic species completely dependent on the oak forest). Alterations of landscape structural integrity were compared for inside and outside Dena PA and at different altitudes. The results show connectivity loss and increased fragmentation of oak remnant patches, but this deforestation is more severe near areas facing direct human impacts and interventions. These are among attributes that are to be considered for zoning PA (such as controlling zone and training/participation zone). At higher altitudes, physical protection and strict control are more effective, while training local communities for stewardship is more essential at lower altitudes for conserving woodland integrity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Human impacts; Metrics; Oak forest; Structural integrity","Anthropogenic Effects; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Humans; Iran; Iran; Altitude control; Deforestation; Environmental protection; Structural integrity; Baseline studies; Conservation areas; Forestlands; Human impact; Landscape conservation; Landscape structures; Metric; Oak forests; Protected areas; Surrounding matrix; anthropogenic effect; deciduous forest; environmental management; environmental protection; landscape protection; protected area; altitude; Article; deforestation; endangered species; endemic species; environmental protection; forest; human impact (environment); Iran; land use; landscape; oak; quantitative analysis; satellite imagery; Sciuridae; Sciurus anomalus; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; human; Conservation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122356176"

Often, they are also expected to help secure livelihoods of poor subsistence, small-scale producers, making the management of PAs often dependent on community support. The usefulness of analyzing the perceptions of PAs among local users to improve the effectiveness of PA management is increasingly recognized; however, there are few studies on spatial perceptions, for example, how users perceive the PA’s geographical boundaries or its zoning, and how these can be used in PA zoning. Here, we analyze how local stakeholders perceive two sustainable-use PAs on the Amazon coast, the changes they have brought about, and their current management. We identify and link the mental models of different user groups to formal conceptualizations of the PAs in legal instruments and identify mismatches related to what the PA means to local stakeholders and where it is located, which need to be considered when building a zoning plan. Because of the frequent research in our study area, we also discuss possible research fatigue in this region. We highlight the challenges and opportunities related to promoting spatial literacy and awareness-raising regarding PAs.

Improved stewardship of working lands around protected areas is one solution for conservation planning, but private working lands are vulnerable to development. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), ungulates such as elk (Cervus canadensis) use both protected areas and private lands throughout their annual migrations. We studied patterns of landownership, protection, and conservation challenges within the ranges of migratory elk in the GYE. We used GPS data from 1088 elk in 26 herds to define herd-level seasonal ranges, and extracted covariates related to landownership and protection, land use, and human infrastructure and development. All elk herds used land encompassing >1 ownership type. Most elk herds (92.3 % of herds, n = 24) used the highest proportion of private land in the winter (mean = 36.2 % private land). Most elk herds' winter ranges contained the highest building densities (mean = 1.24 buildings/km2), fence densities (mean = 1.02 km fence/km2), and cattle grazing (mean = 1.9 cows/km2), compared to migratory and summer ranges. Out of all ranges, 36.5 % of ranges did not have any zoning regulations, indicating the potential for future development. Our results show that elk in the GYE rely on habitat outside of protected areas, and face landscape-scale conservation challenges such as habitat fragmentation from human development, particularly in winter ranges. Future conservation strategies for wildlife in this system need to encompass coordination across both public and private land to ensure migratory connectivity. © 2022","Disturbance; Easements; Elk; Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem; Land use; Protection; Zoning","Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem; United States; habitat fragmentation; landownership","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139297430"

It would be expected that marine conservation, especially the designation of marine protected areas (MPAs), would be incorporated into MSP. In practice, however, MSP and MPA designation are often taking place in parallel to each other, with relatively little integration between them, partly because of marine conservation's longer history and established institutional frameworks which cannot be simply subsumed into MSP processes. There are, nonetheless, a series of options available by which the two sets of process could be more closely linked. These options can be conceptualised temporally, by, for example, MSP improving the status of pre-existing MPAs, or spatially, by, for example, facilitating the creation of multiple-use MPAs. These difficulties and possibilities are illustrated through two national European experiences. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation; England; Germany; Marine protected area; Marine spatial planning; Multiple-use; Ocean management; Ocean policy; Zoning","England; Germany; United Kingdom; conservation; institutional framework; marine policy; protected area; spatial planning; zoning policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101321905"

Coastal dunes have been greatly altered by different historical and current land uses, causing the loss of their natural and cultural values. On the coast of Tenerife there are volcanic and organogenic sand active and relict dunes with multiple land uses, the most prominent of which is tourism (also the main cause of their deterioration). The aim of this study is to demonstrate the relevance of geomorphosites associated to the aeolian depositional systems of Tenerife as volcanic geoheritage through the application of international methodologies used for these evaluations, and to propose geotourism uses that will contribute to their sustainability. In Tenerife there are thirteen aeolian system geomorphosites in which palaeodunes, active dunes and a combination of both have been identified, 53.9% of which are protected. The main historical and current uses are related to grazing, sand mining and tourism. These different land uses have produced the degradation of these landforms, which have induced the loss of some of their scientific and additional values. The average score for the scientific values (0.58) is higher than for the additional values (0.41) in most of the thirteen selected geomorphosites; the values lie in the middle of the range and there is no correlation between the scientific and additional values (R2 = 0.17). The geotourism proposal presented in this study is associate to the volcanic diversity of the coast of Tenerife and should be aimed at both the general public and specialists. The number of visitors should be restricted and sustainable according to the zoning laws for the regulations and use of the protected areas; and it should use the net of authorized paths which already exists in the geomorphosites. To this end, certain facilities will be required to help disseminate and promote the heritage of Tenerife’s dune geomorphosites through panels, websites, apps or QR codes. © 2022 by the authors.

A total of 44 MPAs were identified, including 25 in Brazil, six in Uruguay, and 13 in Argentina. Most of the MPAs are relatively small (<100 km2) and are classified as sustainable use areas, usually without any particular fishery regulation or spatial zoning. Therefore, even though approximately 19% of the franciscana´s distribution is legally protected by some type of MPA, the long-term survival of the species depends on additional measures largely related to the management of the fisheries both inside and outside of the protected areas. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Irrational development activities lead to the degradation of habitat quality and loss of biodiversity, especially in arid inland areas where the ecological environment is fragile. In this study, the InVEST model is used to evaluate the habitat quality and degradation degree of the Ebinur Lake Basin from 1990 to 2020, while the PLUS model is used to predict the land use change in the Ebinur Lake Basin under various scenarios. Combined with the results of ecological zoning planning, the spatial distribution of land use and habitat quality under the inertia development (ID) and ecological protection (EP) scenarios in 2030 were compared and analyzed, and the optimal scenario was selected. The following four conclusions are drawn: (1) From 1990 to 2020, cultivated land, grassland, and construction land significantly increased, while forest land, water bodies, and unused land significantly decreased. (2) The habitat quality of the watershed showed an increasing trend followed by a decreasing trend. The area proportion of high habitat quality has always exceeded 50 % of the total area of the watershed with a high level of habitat quality. (3) Furthermore, combined with habitat quality and the human footprint index (HFI), ecological zoning planning for the basin was conducted. The three ecological zones were divided into key protected areas, key restoration areas, and moderate development zones, with area proportions of 53.69 %, 29.37 %, and 16.93 %, respectively. (4) By comparing habitat quality under the ID scenario and the EP scenario in 2030, we found that the area of high habitat quality increased by 2730.06 km2 under the EP scenario, which improved the overall level of habitat quality, and was more conducive to the ecological security protection of the basin. The results of this study may benefit the analysis of the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of habitat quality in the Ebinur Lake Basin and provide a reference for the improvement of habitat quality in the inland arid region. © 2022 The Author(s)","Habitat quality; Human footprint index; InVEST model; PLUS model","China; Ebinur Lake; Xinjiang Uygur; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Forestry; Lakes; Land use; Quality control; Watersheds; Area proportions; Ebinur lakes; Ecological protection; Habitat quality; Human footprint index; Human footprints; InVEST model; Lake basins; PLUS model; Temporal and spatial variation; biodiversity; ecological footprint; habitat quality; index method; land use change; protected area; spatiotemporal analysis; watershed; Zoning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142437043"

China proposed the establishment of a national park (NP) system and carried out transformative explorations in 10 pilot NPs, however, it is unclear to what extent the pilot NPs represent China's biodiversity and resolve management issues. To answer this question, we assessed the performance of the pilot NPs by analyzing the representativeness across typical ecosystems, biodiversity priority areas, and ecosystem services, and by analyzing the management effectiveness of reorganizing the existing PAs and improving the management intensity and man-land relationships. We found that China's pilot NPs achieved improved representativeness and management effectiveness through range expansion and optimization, institution streamlining, and cohesive management. Compared with the existing PAs, the area of protected typical ecosystems, biodiversity priority areas, and key areas of ecosystem services in the 10 pilot NPs increased by 59.6%, 59.6%, and 54.1% on average, respectively, with a similar land cost overall. The 10 pilot NPs integrated 142 existing PAs of seven categories. The protected areas expanded by 19.4%, and the area under strict protection increased by 42.1%. Additionally, the pilot NPs effectively reduced human disturbance and improved management effectiveness through necessary relocation and enhanced land management. Moving forward, the boundaries and zoning of the NPs should be further optimized, and efforts should be directed to strengthen the governing capacity building, improve the legislation system, increase the financing investment, and promote the value realization of ecological products. © 2022 The Authors","Biodiversity; Ecosystem Services; Management Effectiveness; National Parks; Protected areas; Representativeness","China; Conservation; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Expansion; Investments; Ecosystem services; Management effectiveness; Management issues; National park systems; National parks; Performance; Protected areas; Range expansion; Range optimization; Representativeness; biodiversity; ecosystem service; legislation; national park; protected area; range expansion; zoning; Biodiversity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142315617"

Since the use of wood resources disturbs ecosystems, overharvesting destroys local ecosystems, resulting in a decline in ecosystem services. Therefore, there is a need to balance the use of wood resources by people with the health of the ecosystem. In this study, we evaluated wood provisioning in newly established national parks in Okinawa Main Island, Japan, for future sustainable management. We clarified the spatial distribution between the forest stand volume obtained from LiDAR data, the logging sites before the national park designation, and national park zoning. We found that the buffer zone contains some forests with high stand volume that continue from the core area. There had not been much logging in recent years, but most logging sites were located in the buffer zone and within 200m from roads. Forests with aged stands and high stand volume are important as buffers to prevent isolation of the core area. Therefore, park managers need to consider not only the legal regulations for each zone but also the continuity with the surrounding natural environment to prevent isolation of the core area. Understanding the spatial distribution of wood resources and park zoning relationships at a fine-scale resolution will be useful for managing buffer zones where there is competition between conservation and resource use. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Annual allowable cut; Ecosystem services; Forested landscape; Park management; Sustainability; Yambaru National Park","Aged; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans; Japan; Trees; Wood; Japan; Okinawa [Ryukyu Islands]; Ryukyu Islands; assessment method; buffer zone; ecosystem health; ecosystem service; food provisioning; forest ecosystem; lidar; logging (timber); national park; protected area; satellite data; spatial distribution; subtropical region; sustainability; sustainable development; tropical forest; wood; Article; conservation biology; controlled study; cultivated land; ecosystem; forest management; forest stand; human; Japan; logging; national park; photography; resource management; sustainable development; tropical rain forest; wood; aged; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; tree","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103035399"

This study aimed to investigate the necessity and feasibility of implementing fire management efforts in fire-prone Brazilian conservation unit on Bananal Island. Specifically, this study entailed a comprehensive study of pattens underlying the occurrence of forest fires (FFs) on Bananal Island using geotechnical tools, meteorological variables, and occurrence records. Fuzzy logic was applied to develop a forest fire risk zoning based on the following variables: land use and occupation, altitude, slope, relief orientation, air and land surface temperatures, precipitation, and proximity to heat zones. To analyze the patterns of FFs, fire occurrence records and meteorological variables between 2010 and 2020 were used. The validation of the model was conducted based on fire risk classes and burned areas between 2010 and 2019. The results showed that 3.61%, 16.41%, 33.65%, 30.17%, and 16.17% of the area was at very low risk, low risk, moderate risk, high risk, and very high risk, respectively, with respect to fire occurrence. Of the fire occurrences, 92% occurred in clear fields (native pastures); furthermore, 75.9% of these fires were arsons. The results of this study will allow managers of Ilha do Bananal to develop fire management plans that involve the well-directed use of resources, specifically the appropriate channeling of resources to the neediest areas. This means acting directly in areas with the highest risks and in surrounding sensitive regions, such as gallery forests. Additionally, our results justify the investment in education campaigns, as most fires result from vandalism. Finally, we conclude that the approach outlined in this study will not only improve fire prevention efforts on Bananal Island but can also be applied in other areas. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Burned; Conservation units; Forest Protection; Fuzzy logic; GIS techniques","Conservation; Deforestation; Economics; Fires; GIS; Land Use; Amazonia; Bananal Island; Brazil; Tocantins; Computer circuits; Conservation; Deforestation; Economics; Fire hazards; Fireproofing; Fires; Geographic information systems; Land use; Landforms; Burned; Conservation units; Fire management; Fire occurrences; Fire prevention; Forest fires; Forest protection; Fuzzy-Logic; GIS technique; Meteorological variables; cerrado; environmental factor; environmental protection; fire management; forest ecosystem; forest fire; GIS; island; land surface; spatiotemporal analysis; Fuzzy logic","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150191114"

ES assessments are relevant tools in multi-purpose landscapes, such as agricultural landscapes situated within natural protected areas where the challenge is to meet both local livelihoods and conservations goals. La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve in south-eastern Mexico has evidenced tensions among social actors due to territorial disputes; local farmers and conservation institutions contest the landscape's land use and ES benefits. OBJECTIVE: We conducted an empirical study in the territory of a small mountain community within this biosphere reserve. We assessed ES in alternative land use scenarios with the aim to generate knowledge in support of local land use and management decisions. METHODS: We first characterised local land use using mixed methods research and quantified six locally relevant ES: Livelihood ES valued by farmers including forage production, firewood stocks, and resin production, and ES valued by conservation institutions including tree cover, riparian corridor, and tree diversity. Next, four alternative land use scenarios were built based on expert knowledge and stakeholder participation, with a different balance and integration of production and conservation objectives. We then estimated these ES in the four scenarios and assessed ES trade-offs at the farm and landscape level. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that farm diversity mattered. Though farms presented similar trade-offs in each of the scenarios, the magnitude of these trade-offs varied considerably among small vs. large farms. At the landscape level, the intensive cattle ranching and forest restoration scenarios presented hard trade-offs, compared to the more moderate integrated agroforestry practices scenario. Moreover, the land use zoning scenario, a management strategy promoted by conservation institutions, did not differ from the current landscape nor offer an improvement in conservation indicators. Livestock played a key role in the land system, and trade-offs between forage production and other ES were recurrent across scenarios and spatial scales. Still, management practices that harness biodiversity and ES can improve sustainability of cattle ranching, and thus reconcile production and conservation goals. SIGNIFICANCE: Relevant ES assessments in agricultural landscapes support local land management decisions, integrate the social–ecological context, and scale up land use scenarios from the farm (fine scale) to the landscape level. © 2021 The Authors","Decision-making; Ecosystem service assessments; Land use planning; Natural protected areas; Scenarios; Trade-offs","Chiapas; Mexico; Mexico [North America]; Sepultura Biosphere Reserve; Sepultura Biosphere Reserve; Matthiola; agroforestry; biodiversity; conservation; ecosystem; forage; knowledge","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120411830"

Therefore, connectivity between habitat patches is becoming even more important. China began building national parks with the primary purpose of protecting nationally representative natural ecosystems and maintaining the integrity of their structure, processes and functions. Research is necessary to improve the internal connectivity of national parks and to propose suggestions for existing functional zoning and biological corridors. In this study, Qianjiangyuan National Park was selected as an example park, and landscape fragmentation was evaluated exponentially and simulated visually. The habitat characteristics of protected species in the region, morphological spatial pattern analysis and the delta of the probability of connectivity were used together to identify key habitat patches and their importance levels in the study area. Potential habitat corridors in the region were then obtained using least-cost path analysis and gravity modeling methods based on the distribution of key habitat and the migration costs of target species. The results of this study show that the disturbed landscape of the study area is dominated by tea plantations and drylands, with central roads being an important factor affecting the overall landscape connectivity. In terms of the distribution of key habitat patches, the mountains have a high value. In terms of area, their size is not directly proportional to their importance for maintaining landscape connectivity in the region, but large area patches are generally of higher importance. In terms of distance, key habitats that are closer to each other have a stronger correlation and a greater possibility for species migration. Combined with the functional zoning of Qianjiangyuan National Park, the setting of strictly protected areas and recreational areas is reasonable, and traditional use areas and ecological conservation areas could be appropriately adjusted according to the distribution of key habitats. The important corridor in the middle of the ecological conservation area is crucial for the overall connectivity of the national park, and the connectivity between strict protected areas will depend on successful protection of the ecological conservation area. © 2021 by the authors.

This work takes advantage of a nationwide titling campaign in Panama to explore the effect of private titling on forest cover across a heterogeneous landscape covering all stages of forest transition and diverse tenure arrangements. Situated in a broader matched analysis of the influence of zoning and tenure on forest cover, private management is estimated to have contributed to the deforestation of 1750–3650 km2 of mature forest nationwide from 1990 to 2020 with an average marginal effect of 15.3%. Conversely, Protected Areas and Indigenous Comarcas are estimated to have protected 1700–3900 km2 and 500–1250 km2 of mature forest, respectively. Private titling is associated with increased deforestation both during titling and years after, supporting observations that the titling process itself encourages speculative deforestation by title seekers and that private landholders value natural forests less than other land uses such as cattle. By disaggregating the data by region to highlight different stages of forest transition as well as by processes of deforestation and forest growth, this analysis shows that while private titling accelerates deforestation, it also encourages investment in reforestation. This presents a paradox for private titles and forests where agencies may perversely encourage speculative deforestation by creating stronger markets for forest-ready landscapes than for intact natural forests. In cases such as this one, where deforestation helps to secure a title, this paradox is confounded when having a title is set as a precondition for participation in a forest conservation program. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deforestation; Land-use zoning; Panama; Private titles; Protected areas; Tenure","Panama [Central America]; conservation planning; deforestation; forest cover; land tenure; protected area; Sustainable Development Goal; zoning system","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112119441"

This type of zoning is regarded as a combination of territorialy interconnected groups of geosystems in terms of the set of physical-geographical factors, and structural and functional features. For the Vaninskii and Sovetsko-Gavanskii municipal districts of Khabarovsk krai we identified geosystems of high ecological value at the regional level. The specially protected areas now make up a mere 26.8% of their total area, and this is inadequate to ensure their conservation. It is therefore worthwhile to include in the recommended ecological framework of municipal districts this category of geosystems with the necessary regulations of the modalities of nature management. As a special element of the ecological framework of the territory, the area of the conventionally unchanged and slightly modified geosystems with ecological functions of regional significance will additionally make up 26.3% (taking into consideration their inclusion in a number of other elements of the framework). As a result, the total proportion of lands in the ecological framework of the districts will be increased to 58.6% of their area, which corresponds to the optimal indicators of rational nature management in the subzone of the middle and southern taiga. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","ecological framework of the territory; ecologically significant landscapes; environment-forming functions; landscape and ecological zoning; Vaninskii and Sovetsko-Gavanskii municipal districts","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152002557"

However, there is no systematic study being conducted on the EDLNNR's historical trend of land use/land cover (LULC). Therefore, it is crucial to understand the relationship between changes in functional zones' boundary and spatio-temporal changes in the LULC from pre-establishment to the present time for adequate protection. The objective of this study is to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of LULC changes from 1979 to 2019 in the three functional zones of EDLNNR during the dry season. LULC transition matrix and landscape metrics at the landscape level were also used to investigate the land type dynamics and landscape fragmentation, respectively. An increase in the marsh area was observed in all three functional zones of EDLNNR. The built-up area was increased due to the conversion of agricultural land. The landscape metrics-based analysis showed that the EDLNNR was less fragmented in 2019 than the previous record in 2016, due to the adjustment action of the three functional zones' boundary of the EDLNNR in 2018. The excluded area of the EDLNNR was from its experimental zone, which includes densely populated areas and surrounding agricultural land and woodland. The spatio-temporal LULC change information can offer effective management and conservation of different functional zones of the EDLNNR.

Yet, mismatches in the scale at which these two priority issues are planned and implemented have exacerbated biodiversity loss, erosion of ecosystem services and declining human quality of life. India houses the second largest human population on the planet, while < 5% of the country’s land area is effectively protected for conservation. This warrants landscape-level conservation planning through a judicious mix of land-sharing and land-sparing approaches combined with the co-production of ecosystem services. Through a multifaceted assessment, we prioritize spatial extents of land parcels that, in the face of anthropogenic threats, can safeguard conservation landscapes across India’s biogeographic zones. We found that only a fraction (~15%) of the priority areas identified here are encompassed under India’s extant Protected Area network, and furthermore, that several landscapes of high importance were omitted from all previous global-scale assessments. We then examined the spatial congruence of priority areas with administrative units earmarked for economic development by the Indian government and propose management zoning through state-driven and participatory approaches. Our spatially explicit insights can help meet the twin goals of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development in India and other countries across the Global South. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Biodiversity conservation; Biodiversity loss; Co-production; Conservation planning; Ecosystem services; Human population; Land areas; Landscape level; Quality of life; Well being; Conservation","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147508486"

At the regional scale, some ecosystem services play a more critical role in regional ecological security and social development. Therefore, it is necessary to identify key ecosystem services and prioritize their protection and management to ensure their sustainable and effective delivery in a region. This paper proposes a set of research schemes that comprehensively examine the supply, trade-off, and demand of ecosystem services, using the city belt along the Chaobai River in north China as an example for empirical research. Demarcating a 1 km × 1 km area, we first analyze the spatial-temporal supply patterns of Net Primary Productivity (NPP), Water Yield (WY), Soil Retention (SR), Sand Retention (SAR), and Habitat Quality (HQ) from 2010 to 2015 using the CASA, InVEST, USLE, RWEQ and InVEST models, respectively. Thereafter, we define the Regional Key Ecosystem Service (RKES) through regional reality and Spearman correlation analysis among the five ecosystem services. Finally, based on the disparity between the supply and demand of the RKES, we develop a land zoning approach and propose targeted zoning management measures. The results show that WY was the RKES in the study area. The demand for WY did not exceed supply, and the supply and demand were always in a state of mismatch. The stable area with surplus supply and demand of WY was designated as an Ecological Protected Area, a core area to guarantee the RKES. In general, our scheme can be targeted to address the protection of RKES from the perspective of land management. This is of great significance for ensuring regional ecological security and sustainable use of ecosystem services, and could be used to inform the formulation of ecological protection policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Supply and demand; Tradeoff and synergy; Water yield","Chaobai River; China; Belts; Conservation; Economic and social effects; Economics; Land use; Zoning; Ecological protection; Ecological security; Empirical research; Management measures; Net primary productivity; Protection and management; Social development; Spearman correlation; ecosystem service; land management; net primary production; protected area; water yield; zoning policy; Article; China; empirical research; environmental management; environmental parameters; environmental planning; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; habitat quality; human activities; land use; net primary productivity; priority journal; sand retention; social evolution; soil retention; water supply; water yield; Ecosystems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096156668"

In Indonesia, land spatial planning has firstly been implemented, followed by the spatial zonation of coastal waters. Therefore, to achieve sustainable coastal zone management, the harmonization between the regional spatial plan or RTRW with the zoning plan for coastal waters and small islands or RZWP3K is urgently needed. This paper aims to examine the spatial problems in the process of integrating these two spatial plans. Using the spatial review method, the stages of study consist of forming the seamless spatial planning maps of 8 provincial regions in Indonesia that have stipulated the second regional regulation on spatial planning regimes and then integrated them with the coastal waters spatial planning zonation map (rzwp3k). The findings show the potential conflict in some areas, especially in protected areas with cultivation and public use, and between the cultivation areas, fisheries, and industries. Other findings are on the technical aspect, which shows the differences in the coastal area due to the use of two different coastlines and base maps. Regarding substance, there are differences in the content of the framework of the RTRW and RZWP3K mandates in regional regulation.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Coastal engineering; Conservation; Regional planning; Zoning; Coastal development; Coastal zone management; Marine Spatial Planning; Potential conflict; Protected areas; Spatial planning; Spatial problems; Technical aspects; Coastal zones","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107217698"

Based on the research background of different geomorphological zoning, we selected the MODIS NDVI data from 2000 to 2020 to analyze the NDVI trends using a univariate linear model. A partial correlation analysis and multiple correlation analysis were used to reveal the influence of temperature and precipitation on NDVI trends. Fourteen factors related to meteorological factors, topographic factors, geological activities, and human activities were selected, and the Geographically Weighted Regression model was used to study the mechanisms driving NDVI change. The results were as follows: (1) The NDVI value of Giant Panda National Park has fluctuated and increased in the past 21 years, with an annual growth rate of 4.7%/yr. Affected by the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, the NDVI value fluctuated greatly from 2008 to 2012, and reached its peak in 2018. (2) The NDVI in 94% of the study area improved, and the most significant improvement areas were mainly distributed in the northern and southern regions of Southwest Subalpine and Middle Mountain and the Xiaoxiangling area. Affected by the distribution of fault zones and their local activities, vegetation degradation was concentrated in the Dujiangyan–Anzhou area of Hengduan Mountain Alpine Canyon. (3) The Geographically Weighted Regression analysis showed that natural factors were dominant, with climate and elevation having a double-factor enhancement effect, the peak acceleration of ground motion and fault zone having a superimposed effect, and river density and slope having a double effect, all of which had a significant impact on the NDVI value of the surrounding area. To optimize the ecological security pattern of the Giant Panda National Park, we recommended strengthening the construction of ecological security projects through monitoring meteorological changes, preventing, and controlling geo-hazards, and optimizing the layout and intensity of human activities. © 2022 by the authors.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the number of MPAs increased rapidly from 0.67% in 2000–7.4% by the end of 2018. Yet only around 5.9% of the world's coral reef area is included within MPAs and the implementation of MPA networks in areas beyond national jurisdiction remains limited. Here we report results on the evaluation of the ecological criteria suggested by the IUCN for the potential implementation of a MPAn between Nicaragua, Jamaica, and Colombia on the southwestern side of the Caribbean Sea. We have reviewed the different legislative structures for protection in place and the international and regional agreements endorsed by Colombia, Nicaragua, and Jamaica in force in 2020, together with biophysical connectivity studies in the Caribbean basin. Results indicate that the three countries: (i) have similar ecosystems open to protection, (ii) have already developed different governance instruments to protect them, (iii) there is a coherence between permitted and prohibited activities that provides strong governance related support for the potential MPA network for all zoning categories and iv) have the legislation and common ground to lead a successful implementation. The study concludes that the establishment of an MPA network in the southwestern part of the Caribbean will be advantageous for the protection of other marine ecosystems in the basin, addressing transboundary issues by focusing on connectivity and the already established MPA. © 2023","Caribbean sea; MPA network; SeaFlower reserve","Colombia; Jamaica; Nicaragua; environmental protection; governance approach; legislative implementation; marine ecosystem; marine park; marine policy; policy implementation; protected area; United Nations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147583665"

At present, China is making every effort to build a nature-protection system, with national parks as the main body, and this approach considers China′s urgent goals of obtaining carbon neutrality and mitigating climate change. It is of great significance to the national carbon-neutralization strategy to accurately predict the carbon sink capacity of national park ecosystems under the background of global change. To evaluate and predict the dynamics of the carbon sink capacity of national parks under climate change and different management measures, we combined remote-sensing observations, model simulations and scenario analyses to simulate the change in the carbon sink capacity of the proposed Kunlun Mountain National Park ecosystem over the past two decades (2000–2020) and the change in the carbon sink capacity under different zoning controls and various climate change scenarios from 2020 to 2060. Our results show that the carbon sink capacity of the proposed Kunlun Mountain National Park area is increasing. Simultaneously, the carbon sink capacity will be improved with the implementation of park management and control measures; which will be increased by 2.04% to 2.13% by 2060 in the research area under multiple climate change scenarios.

In this study, we used ensemble modelling to explain the distribution of Near Threatened Indo-Pacific (IP) bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in coastal waters at the North West Cape (NWC), Western Australia (WA), an area encompassing a marine protected area (MPA) and adjacent unprotected coastal waters. Analyses used dolphin sighting data collected during boat-based surveys conducted from 2013 to 2015 and 2018 to 2019. Overall, the distribution of IP bottlenose dolphins was best explained by distance to coast (up to 2,000 m) and distance to boat ramp (up to 7,000 m). Areas of high probability of occurrence for dolphins extended from the tip and down the eastern side of the NWC and overlapped with designated sanctuary zones as well as waters beyond the boundaries of the Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP). Distribution and habitat preferences varied slightly with season. In autumn, dolphin distribution was best explained by distance to coast and water depth with a higher likelihood of observing dolphins 1,000–2,000 m from the coast and in water depths of 7–10 m deep. During winter months, distance to coast (1,000–2,000 m) and sea surface temperature (SST) (21.5–23.5°C) were the most important explanatory variables, with presence in coastal lagoons to the west of the NWC more likely than other seasons. During spring, areas of moderate to high probability of dolphin occurrence were mainly located outside the NMP, with marine park zone (outside the NMP and Sanctuary zones within the NMP, the two zones with the highest probability of IP bottlenose dolphin occurrence) and water depth (waters 7–13 m deep) best explaining dolphin distribution. This study highlights the importance of inshore areas of the NWC for IP bottlenose dolphins and the potential vulnerability of this species to increasing and cumulative anthropogenic stressors associated with these areas. Results of this study should be considered in future zoning reviews and adaptive management efforts of the NMP allowing for effective management of this Near Threatened species. © Copyright © 2021 Haughey, Hunt, Hanf, Passadore, Baring and Parra.","conservation; Exmouth Gulf; Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins; management; marine protected area; Ningaloo Marine Park; species distribution modelling","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110255762"

The Luki biosphere reserve, while under a status of protected area, experiences anthropic pressures without spare. In order to control the activities of local populations and particularly to implement the principles of natural resources management enacted by the Man and Biosphere program of the United Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, a zoning plan has been implemented in the Luki biosphere reserve since 1979. The aim of this study was to evaluate the floristic composition, the diversity and structural parameters on floristic groupings of forest tree species in the Luki Biosphere Reserve (LBR) to evaluate whether the implemented zoning has an effect on plant diversity and population structure of forest trees species in the Luki Biosphere Reserve. Floristic data were collected on a set of 15 plots of 1 hectare (ha) each following the management zoning, in which tree species with diameter at breast height (dbh) ≥ 10 cm were measured and identified. Floristic diversity analysis was carried out and the relationship between within plots species richness and physical and chemical properties of soil was established. In total, 6497 individual trees were inventoried belonging to a total of 218 species grouped in 41 families making an average tree density of 433 ± 13 individual per hectare. Two floristic groups emerged from the ordination of species and cluster analysis. Prioria balsamifera and Dialium pachyphyllum were among the most represented and characteristic tree species in the floristics groups. The families Sterculiaceae, Fabaceae, Ebenaceae, Olacaceae, Rubiaceae, Annonaceae, Myristicaceae, Meliaceae and Sapotaceae displayed high values of specific important index. Tree populations from the three zoning displayed an “inverted J” shape in an axil distribution of classes of diameters while the horizontal distribution of tree height displayed a bell structure. A significant difference exists in species richness among zones and floristic groupings. The floristics groupings were distributed following the soil texture. This work provides the basic elements for a sustainable management plan adapted with the current zoning plan in the Luki Biosphere Reserve. © 2023 The Authors","Floristic composition; Floristic groupings; Luki Biosphere reserve; Species richness; Structural organization","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154604306"

These areas would not be much effective without a proper management plan based on their zoning. Due to lack of appropriate criteria with ground check capability, zoning has always been a major challenge for planners. Therefore, this study was carried out to develop a decision algorithm for zoning protection zones 1 and 2 of Hara protected area. This region, with an area of 86,258 hectares, covers a vast range of Mangrove forests and is located between Khamir Port and Qeshm Island in Hormozgan province, Iran. Zoning of the protected areas in this region was performed through identifying the ecologic-based criteria for Restricted Nature Reserve Zone (zone 1) and Protection Zone (zone 2), finalizing and screening them by Delphi questionnaire and weighting those criteria using Entropy Shannon methods. Moreover, the linear model for spatial criteria combination was developed, and layering and criteria combination were performed in Geographic Information System using the designed decision algorithm. The results from zoning the protected areas indicated that zone 1 and zone 2 constituted 5% and 11.38% of the total area, respectively. In other words, the protection zones covered over 16% of the study area. The results also indicated that the criteria linear combination model and the decision algorithm could facilitate accurate zoning of the areas while maintaining their ecologic and human values. © 2021, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Decision algorithm; Delphi method; Multi-criteria decision making; Shannon entropy; Zoning","Hara Biosphere Reserve; Hormozgan; Iran; Qeshm; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Information use; Zoning; Decision algorithms; Ecosystem services; Genetic resources; Linear combination model; Management areas; Management plans; Natural landscapes; Protection zones; algorithm; decision making; ecosystem service; genetic resource; GIS; management practice; mangrove; protected area; Conservation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105453775"

The activities of industrial manufactures in the region did not actually cause a significant negative impact on the ecosystems within its territory, making it possible to preserve the ecosystems typical for the Khibiny. The species richness of phototrophic organisms at the PABGI area is higher than the equal per squares sites in the region. The study presents an analysis of current and types of economic activities that entail a violation of the safety of objects of protection. A differentiated protection regime has been proposed for solution of several heterogeneous problems: the preservation of natural ecosystems, the creation and operation of plant Nurseries, scientific studies, environmental education and natural tourism. The proposed zoning allows the implementation of management for the maintenance, reconstruction, or building of new objects on the territory of the PABSI in the future. The analysis of the territory was carried out on the basis of mapping the locations of species included in the red Data Books of the region and Russia on the basis of data from the herbaria of the Polar-Alpine Botanical Garden-Institute (KPABG), the Institute of Industrial ecology of the North (INEP) and the CRIS information system (http://www.kpabg.ru/cris), taking into account the conservation status, excursion and tourist routes, training sites for climbers. The following zones are allocated on the territory: administrative, scientific-exposition, specially protected and reserved. The most stringent protection regime is determined for the protected area, the softest - for the administrative one. The proposed zoning should contribute to both the unconditional preservation of natural complexes and protected species and the conduct of scientific research and the successful functioning of the PABGI as a scientific organization and sustainable recreational use of the territory. © 2021 Lomonosov Moscow State University.

This process has both positive and negative consequences for people and nature. Significant changes in the regime of rivers and their valleys, flooding of meadows and forests, flooding of soils and changes in the composition of flora and fauna of adjacent territories are taking place. In this article, we consider the restoration of the biodiversity of a site of disturbed lands after the creation of one of the first large reservoirs in Europe – the Dnieper (Zaporozhe) on the River Dnieper, which has existed since 1933. The territory of the Samara floodplains was formed on the floodplain of the mouth of the Samara River, as a result of which the territories of various forest, meadow and bog biotopes were flooded. For almost 90 years, new biotopes have been developing, and populations of plant and animal species, especially waterfowl, have been renewed and enriched. In the conditions of climate change and anthropogenic pressure, the existence of this territory has fallen into question. To control the conservation of biodiversity, it is necessary to apply various management methods, one of which is creation of nature reserves. The article presents the results of a complex of scientific studies that were carried out during the zoning of the regional park Samara Plavni to improve the management of the protection of water areas and river banks. We have investigated: hydrological features, species diversity of the flora and coenotic diversity of the vegetation, fauna of aquatic invertebrates, and terrestrial vertebrates. Zoning of the Regional Landscape Park was based on the composition of stable components of ecosystems. When applying the protected regime in different zones, conditions will be created for the preservation of habitats of species, including those protected in Europe: higher plants (Senecio borysthenicus (DC.) Andrz. ex Czern., Tragopogon borystenicus Artemcz.), reptiles (Emys orbicularis (Linnaeus, 1758), Vipera renardi (Christoph, 1861)), birds (Aythya ferina (Linnaeus, 1758), Vanellus vanellus (Linnaeus, 1758), Haematopus ostralegus Linnaeus, 1758, Numenius arquata (Linnaeus, 1758), Alcedo atthis (Linnaeus, 1758), Lanius excubitor (Linnaeus, 1758)), mammals (Lutra lutra (Linnaeus, 1758)).

Findings revealed that in the next 50 years, the increasing human settlement and associated social-economic needs will erase any remnant wildlife hotspots in the ‘Unrestricted zone’ of the district and reclaim intrusion in its ‘Restricted zone’ of which ANP is part. This raises imminent fear of growing cases of encroachment of human activities into illegal and high-risk zones and a possible second de-gazettement of the park.

The conventional strategy has been to design protected areas based on flagship species; however, this has often proven ineffective for protecting other sympatric wildlife. Here, using China's Giant Panda National Park (GPNP) as an example, we evaluated the effectiveness of integrating multiple conservation parameters for flagship and sympatric endangered species to optimize zoning designations, without compromising or jeopardizing the primary goal of protecting giant pandas. We conducted a stepwise spatial prioritization according to taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity for 48 endangered bird and 23 mammal species. Conservation priority areas for each taxon were spatially congruent across diversity indices but differed between taxa. Species richness provided only a weak indicator of conservation values. The current designation scheme for giant panda protection performs moderately well in terms of sheltering sympatric endangered birds and mammals, but there is still scope for improvement. After balancing competing land uses, we identified 7731 km2 with the highest conservation values across taxa and diversity indices, with 26 % of this optimal priority area lying outside of current core protection zones of the GPNP. We recommend that GPNP's current zoning designation criteria are modified to conserve a broader range of species alongside giant pandas, especially to better protect sites from human disturbance. Our findings also have the broader potential to inform conservation planning for protected areas worldwide, enabling the protection of flagship species to be integrated with broader regional biodiversity conservation. © 2023 The Authors","Alternative land use; Conservation priority area; Endangered species; Giant Panda National Park; Species richness; Zoning designation","China; biodiversity; conservation planning; endangered species; land use; national park; optimization; prioritization; species richness; zoning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151428467"

Due to over exploitation, many problems related to ecosystem degradation have been caused. Ecological restoration of land space is urgent. One of the difficulties in carrying out ecological restoration of territorial space lies in the identification of key areas for ecological restoration and diagnosis of regional ecological problems. In this study, we applied the spatial assessment of ecological sensitivity and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model to quantitatively analyze the overall ecosystem in Huangshi city so as to delimit the ecological restoration division of Huangshi City. The results showed that: (1) The overall distribution rule is that vegetation, such as that in mountains and forests, is dense, the sensitivity around water and wetlands is high, and the distribution of mines in Huangshi is high. (2) For the period 1980-2018, the habitat quality index of Huangshi was good, with a slight decreasing trend. The simulated habitat quality distribution was consistent with the region-dominated land cover type. (3) Huangshi formed a spatial pattern with natural protected areas as the priority protection areas, mining areas as the key restoration areas, and natural protected areas and mining areas as the general restoration areas.

The Tropical Southwestern Atlantic reefs are partially protected by Marine Protected Areas (MPA) that apply spatial zoning as a management strategy. A resilience-based management approach was used to evaluate the effectiveness of no-take areas in improving reef resilience, inside the largest coastal MPA of Brazil. Ecological indicators were used to calculate resilience scores, to test the hypothesis that no-take reefs present higher resilience than tourism reefs. Score values indicated medium–high resilience for both. Despite the similar values, the contribution of the indicators to the score varied between reefs. Herbivorous fish biomass was the main indicator influencing higher scores. Management through spatial zoning and the compliance of this regulation raised the resilience of coral reefs. The main management actions recommended are the creation of no-take areas in coastal habitats such as mangroves and seagrass beds. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Herbivorous fish biomass; Local stressors; No-take efficiency; Sea-urchin","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Southwest); biomass; climate change; coral reef; echinoderm; fish; herbivore; marine park","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145416887"

Here, we compare conservation outcomes for two different kinds of PPAs (allowing limited line fishing, but with or without spearfishing) on sheltered and exposed sides of coral reefs of the southern Great Barrier Reef. Compared with No-Take Marine Reserves (NTMRs), Conservation Park Zones (CPZs; spearfishing allowed), had lower biomass and density of primary fisheries targets. Conversely, Special Management Areas (SMAs; spearfishing prohibited) had similar biomass and density of primary targets to NTMRs, and had greater densities of coral trout (a key fishing target), compared to CPZs. No zoning patterns occurred for non-target species. Both PPA zones supported greater biomass of targets compared to less regulated Habitat Protection Zones, which have more allowable fishing activities. These results indicate that partial protection measures limiting fishing activities can create conservation outcomes for targeted fishes. In particular, we provide evidence to support the premise that prohibition of spearfishing can significantly boost conservation outcomes for PPAs. Zoning outcomes did not differ between exposed and sheltered sides of reefs, despite exposed sites consistently supporting a greater biomass and density of fishes. The success of PPAs, and in particular SMAs, in the region is likely due to a combination of factors including: strong enforcement and subsequent compliance of fishing restrictions, the presence of adjacent effective NTMRs, and a long duration of protection. Our results highlight the valuable contributions that PPAs can make to conservation outcomes in well managed MPAs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Coral reefs; Exposure; Fisheries management; Great Barrier Reef; Marine reserves; Zoning","Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Queensland; coral reef; fishery management; marine park; protected area; zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134794383"

However, the conservation effectiveness of different PA functional zones remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated National Nature Reserves (NNRs) in China to explore and quantify the conservation in their core, buffer, and experimental zones. We compared the area and proportion of forest loss for these functional zones during the period from 2001 to 2018. The results showed that the forest loss in NNRs showed a decreasing trend since 2011, indicating that NNRs reduced the forest loss. There was no significant difference of forest loss proportion (p = 0.42) between the core zones (0.60 ± 1.32%) and buffer zones (0.55 ± 0.88%), implying that their performance in forest conservation was similar. There was a significant difference between experimental and core zones as well as between experimental and buffer zones both in forest loss area and proportion (p ˂ 0.05). We confirmed that the proportion of functional zones significantly affects the conservation effectiveness, i.e., an improper proportion of core zones or buffer zones may lead to forest loss. Therefore, we suggest an optimal proportion of core and buffer zones at 30%–50% and 10%–40%, respectively. Overall, the effectiveness of functional zones in forest nature reserves was assessed on a national scale.

This study introduced a methodology for optimizing the spatial pattern of “production-living-ecological” spaces, called DTTD-MCR-PLUS. Considering the spatial heterogeneity of land expansion costs, the Minimum Cumulative Resistance (MCR) method and mutation detection were applied to conduct quantity optimization in “production-living-ecological” spaces, and a patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model was used to reflect its spatial distribution under three different scenarios containing food security, ecological priority and production priority. Furtherly, the dynamic traffic time data (DTTD) was innovatively introduced to portray living and ecological space expansion cost. The research found that: (1) After the ecological function optimization zoning, the core protection area of Changsha′s ecological space was 4111.41 km2, the edge protection area of ecological space was 2285.29 km2, the key area of production space was 2144.79 km2, and the area of production space was 1928.59 km2. In addition, the area of the concentrated living space expansion area was 2570.99 km2. (2) The multi-scenario results simulated by the coupled DTTD-MCR-PLUS model revealed that: under the living priority scenario, the living space area increased by 43.57%, which was mainly distributed in the southern part of the urban area, the western part of Changsha County, and the eastern part of Yuhua District. Under the ecological priority scenario, the land transition-out of ecological space is the lowest compared with other scenarios, which was 3. 11% lower than that of living priority scenario. Under the food security scenario, the proportion of encroachment of production space into ecological space was accelerated, with an increase of up to 58.79%. (3) The results of coordinating the basic farmland, ecological protection red line, nature protected area, and the optimized Changsha′s “production-living-ecological” spaces in 2030 showed that, the proportions of production space, living space and ecological space were 37.63%, 7.67%, and 54.70%, respectively. © 2022 Authors.

We collected, processed, and spatialized the data in a Geographic Information System. We defined five goals for the creation of the Furna Feia National Park: (i) preservation of the speleological complex, (ii) biodiversity, (iii) scientific development, (iv) education and tourism, and (v) socioeconomic development, and we selected two criteria general and five specific criteria for each goal. For the multi-criteria decision analysis, all identified criteria were mapped and organized and later weighted using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. We build the suitability maps through weighted linear combinations using map algebra techniques. We spatialized and characterized 15 criteria and 25 sub-criteria, which resulted in five suitability maps. Individually, each of the suitability maps provided territorial indicators for achieving the five goals of the Furna Feia National Park. From the aptitude data generated, it is possible to visualize the strengths and weaknesses in the territory. The multi-criteria decision analysis integrated into the Geographic Information System was promising for the determination of strategic areas to reach the goals, facilitating the decision-making process. © 2022, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

The multi-criteria methodology defined by the Instituto de Hidrología, Meteorología y Estudios Ambi-entales (IDEAM) was used with some modifications according to later conceptions of risk theory and disaster management. The total high and very high hazard of wildfire was found in 34.9 % of the SFFI and the total vulnerability for the same categories was 98.5 % for the area. Therefore, the high and very high risk of fires covered 27.3 % of the protected area, located mainly in its central and southwestern regions. Likewise, the moderate risk covered 39.4 % of the Sanctuary. These results propose fires as one of the main disturbances of the SFFI ecosystems and show the high possibility that this phenomenon produces adverse effects on socio-ecological systems.

China has nearly six decades of experience in the practice of MPAs. However, the management effectiveness of China's MPAs has been impeded by issues accumulated over the years. In 2018, the Chinese government embarked on a major institutional reform (2018 Reform) to upgrade its MPAs into natural protected area (NPA) system. This strategic decision and subsequent actions in transforming the existing protected areas (marine and terrestrial) to NPAs have brought substantial changes with significant implications towards an ecosystem-based management approach of China's national system for marine conservation. Based on the investigation of 27 representative MPAs and OECMs across the country, this study used 12 performance indicators to evaluate the management effectiveness of China's MPA system, and identified key issues affecting the effective operation of the system. The results indicated that the major issues hampering management effectiveness include multiple management agencies, lack of systematic planning for classification and zoning, lack of unified and specific legal system, and insufficient financial supports. On this basis, we examined new policy directives and work in progress relating to the reform, highlighted major changes to illustrate the extent to which the key issues being addressed, and pointed out the implications of the 2018 reform towards an ecosystem-based management approach and China's national effort towards global goals of conserving marine biodiversity. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2018 Institutional Reform; China; Management effectiveness of MPA; Marine protected area; Natural protected area","China; biodiversity; endangered species; environmental management; governance approach; institutional reform; marine park; performance assessment; policy analysis; policy reform; protected area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126572002"

However, the protected areas generated via bottom-up processes depend highly on the attitudes of local authorities. Moreover, the performance of protected areas will inevitably be weakened by human activities if there exists an inconsistency between protection and land development. To reveal and solve these problems through top-down approaches, a novel framework for the improvement of protected areas (ERL) is presented in this study. First, the ecological conditions of both the previously-established ERL and land use status quo were assessed through morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and a set of graph-based indicators (e.g., connectivity indices). Second, the low-quality parts of the ERL were improved based on a comparison with the observed land use condition. The results indicated that the ecologically important areas that were excluded from the previously-established ERL can be effectively identified by the combination of MSPA and graph-based indicators. The percentages of high-quality components moderately increased after the improvement. Specifically, low-level core patches can be upgraded by incorporating the ecologically important pixels that were previously neglected. Moreover, many low-quality small islets can be enhanced to better serve the function of temporary habitats. In summary, these results are expected to provide practical guidance for ecological conservation planning and management. More importantly, our proposed zoning framework can be further generalized to the analysis in many other fast-growing regions. © 2021","Ecological conservation; Land use inconsistency; Landscape connectivity; Morphological spatial pattern","Conservation; Ecology; Environmental management; Graphic methods; Spatial variables measurement; Zoning; Area-based; Ecological conservation; Ecological protection; Graph-based; Land use inconsistency; Landscape connectivities; Low qualities; Morphological spatial pattern; Protected areas; Spatial pattern analysis; connectivity; conservation planning; ecological approach; land use; protected area; spatial analysis; zoning; Land use","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113677702"

The results showed that the study area does not present worrisome risks regarding the occurrence of fires, since it is mostly covered by very low and low risk classes.

Restrictions imposed on access to resources by the zoning of the YBR have forced riparian populations into over-exploitation of village lands. Zoning applied to the reserve did not take into account the social dynamics nor the participation of riparian communities in the Yangambi region. Variations in the reserve boundaries have led to substantial uncertainty and were found to be at the root of clashes and latent conflicts between the local population and the YBR managers. To reduce the pressure on the resources of the YBR, we suggest an improvement in agricultural techniques coupled with the participatory delimitation of village exploitation zones, as well as a revitalization of participatory structures. SUMMARY Riparian communities activities threaten conservation in biosphere reserves in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Yangambi Biosphere Reserve (YBR) is no exception to this degradation. Thus, the objective of the presents study was to elucidate the local factors underlying the high pressure on natural resources and analyze the complexity of biosphere reserve zoning management using an interdisciplinary approach combining document review, field surveys and semi-structured interviews. Our results revealed that the zoning applied to the YBR did not take into account social dynamics. With population growth, the riparian community is doomed to remain in restricted areas, leading to over-exploitation of the space and land degradation, forcing the population to travel long distances to reach fertile plots into the protected area. Also, the lack of employment and the absence of participatory zoning also exacerbate tensions between the manager and the riparian community. For an effective management of the YBR, political authorities should become more involved in the participatory zoning of conservation areas and village exploitations. In addition, they should improve farming techniques to mitigate soil degradation. © 2021 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

Contained within conservation forests are the 54 national parks, of which nine are predominantly marine, six are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and five are Ramsar wetland sites. This chapter investigates Indonesia’s mountainous national parks, which accounts for around 9% of the archipelago’s landmass. The first batch of five national parks was designated in 1980, and the number increased gradually, reaching 41 by 2003. The current crop of 54 national parks are defined as conservation areas that possess native ecosystems managed via zoning to facilitate research, education, biodiversity and tourism goals. Efforts have been made to fade out the ‘fences and fines’ approach in favour of a more participatory approach to PA management. However, ineffective conservation is revealed by the influx of tourists at popular destinations such as Mount Bromo (2,329 m), an active volcano in the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. Unregulated nature-based tourism at Bromo and other mountainous national parks has negative environmental impacts such as air and water pollution, effects on wildlife behaviour, habitat deterioration, solid waste accumulation, erosion of the rim of the volcano, vandalism, and illegal flora harvesting. Management tools such as cost recovery mechanisms and climber permits are investigated as potential counter-strategies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Collaborative management; Governance; Indonesia; Mount Bromo; National parks","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126724615"

We assessed whether multi-use zoning of the Giant Panda National Park (GPNP) could achieve the goal of protecting the panda population and its habitat, while also promoting community development. We integrate panda presence data, human disturbance distribution, and environmental factors to evaluate panda habitat suitability, the effectiveness of zoning designations, and the impact of human disturbance on panda habitat. Our results show that panda habitat suitability has been partially improved, as certain areas of increased in suitability or stabilized (maintained suitability) across the research region between 2001–2003 and 2011–2013, based on the 3rd and 4th national surveys of the giant panda. Most of the optimum and suitable habitat for panda were located in the core protection area of the GPNP. However, the optimum habitat in the general control area is often located at the junction with the core protection area, indicating a particular need to strengthen management in these areas. Meanwhile, the encounter rates of livestock grazing were highest in optimum habitat and unsuitable habitat. As such, particular attention needs to be paid to the pressures on wildlife caused by human disturbances, such as livestock grazing, in the general control area. Our analyses and these findings have important implications for giant panda conservation and GPNP construction. © 2021 The Authors","Conservation; Development; Giant panda; Giant panda National Park; Mixed-use; Zoning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104058291"

However, compared with the many achievements in the study of ecological security, transregional cultural landscape security research lacks enough attention to match its importance. In the context of advocacy of ‘connecting practices’ between nature and culture in the field of international heritage conservation, this paper developed an approach for constructing transregional vernacular cultural landscape security patterns and identifying the key protected areas. A method is put forward based on the case of the Yangtze River Delta Demonstration Area, one of the fastest urbanizing regions in China, and included the following three steps: (1) analyze the core values of the transregional vernacular cultural landscape from a long-time series and multi-scale perspective; (2) integrate ecological security assessment and value security evaluation by combining qualitative with quantitative methods; (3) build a comprehensive vernacular cultural landscape security pattern to identify key protected areas and develop a zoning and grading conservation strategy toolkit. The results proved that our new method could effectively build a cross-regional network of integrated spatial and functional relationships between the historical cultural and natural landscape and have great significance in improving the level of transregional territorial spatial governance. © 2023 by the authors.","cultural landscape security pattern; digital heritage landscapes; landscape heritage conservation and management; nature–culture; vernacular cultural landscape","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151423168"

The Conference was held September 26–30, 2022 in St. Petersburg (Proceedings…, 2022). 123 geobotanists from 25 cities of Russia participated in the Conference as well as our colleagues from Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Vietnam. The conference activity was held in three main topics: “Vegetation diversity and conservation”, “Structure and dynamics of plant communities”, “Vegetation geography and cartography”. At the plenary session and section meetings 62 oral and 56 poster presentations were presented. Three “roundtable” talk sessions were held: two of them were dedicated to the problems of vegetation classification and the last — to the issues of geobotanical terminology. A significant part of the reports at the section “Diversity and protection of plant communities” was devoted to the classification of vegetation. The most part of authors used methods of floristic classification (BrownBlanquet approach), but general analytic surveys were presented only in some works, and the rest were devoted to regional and local prodromuses of individual unions or to descriptions of lower syntaxa. A significant part of geobotanists follows the traditional principles of the Russian and Soviet school of dominantdeterminant classification; the two other approaches to vegetation classification were applied in single reports: topologicalecological and geographicalgenetic. Several papers have been devoted to the classification of habitat types. A significant part of vegetation studies have been carried out on the territory of protected areas: nature reserves, sanctuaries, national parks and natural landmarks: from the westernmost — Belovezhskaya Pushcha (Belarus) to the easternmost — the Bastak Reserve (Jewish Autonomous Region) and the Koryak Reserve (Kamchatka Region). Many of the reports at the section “Structure and dynamics of plant communities” concerned the study of vegetation dynamics after anthropogenic impacts, which are the main destabilizing factors of vegetation cover. Very few studies related to climate change have been presented. Several reports analyzed the demographic structure of populations. Few reports were also devoted to the statistical modelling of vegetation dynamics. The modern approach based on the functional characteristics of plants is just beginning to develop in Russian geobotany. Rapidly developing machine learning methods are gradually being introduced into the arsenal of geobotanical science methods — for the purposes of vegetation classification and vegetation mapping. Research in the botanical geography and cartography continues in various regions of our country, in Belarus and Kazakhstan. The positive aspects in cartographic work are the increasing use of remote sensing data and tools for their processing, as well as the compilation of applied maps based on vegetation maps to solve various practical problems. However, a small number of reports were presented in the section “Vegetation geography and cartography”, which may reflect a decrease in interest in this area and a lack of specialists. In addition, it should be noted that very few works devoted to major botanicalgeographic generalizations have been carried out in recent decades. Less and less geobotanists are engaged in middle and smallscale vegetation mapping, which would continue and develop the traditions of the national school of geobotanical mapping and zoning. © 2022 Russian Academy of Sciences, V.L.

Georeferenced habitat maps can improve management of isolated tropical coastal and marine ecosystems, where rapid unsustainable anthropogenic coastal development often occurs. In this study, SSS was employed to map subtidal marine habitats of Principe Island (Gulf of Guinea, West Africa) to determine areas of especial interest for biodiversity or marine resource conservation. The SSS methodology was applied, during the BIO-Príncipe Scientific Expedition (2016), in four target areas, both inside and outside its UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, covering 675 ha between 3 and 30 m depth, also combining SCUBA diving and video transects. These areas were chosen based on their geographical location and habitat information, provided by the local stakeholders. Over the total surface mapped, five main habitats were recorded: sandy seabeds (flat sandbanks and rippled sandbanks), rhodolith seabeds (rhodoliths interspersed with scleractinian coral colonies and macroalgae), biogenic (mud/sedimentary) seabeds, and rocky seabed (bedrock and rocky reefs). In the northern, eastern, and southern areas of the island, sandy bottoms with ripples, interspersed with small biogenic sedimentary beds and rhodolith bottoms predominated. The southwestern area, Baía das Agulhas, concentrated the greatest variability and richness of habitats, including the largest rhodolith seascape. This study provided a consistent and detailed dataset to support the creation and design of future MPAs, already planned by the Principe's government, adding including essential information on areas containing key habitats (e.g. rhodoliths) not detected in previous reports. © 2022 The Author(s)","Atlantic Ocean; Benthic cartography; Habitat variability; Marine conservation; Rhodoliths; Scleractinian corals; Side Scan Sonar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143734242"

Marine protected areas are powerful conservation tools and often include zones which vary in the level of fishing restriction, including fully protected (no-take) zones, partially protected zones (limited fishing), and less protected “open” fishing zones. Here, we compare outcomes from fully protected, partially protected, and “open” fishing zones on inshore fringing reefs of the Great Barrier Reef with a history of cyclone-induced habitat disturbance. Biomass of target and non-target fish groups, along with the coral cover and structural complexity of benthic habitats, was compared among zones. There was a strong positive effect of full protection from fishing on targeted fish biomass, and a comparatively modest effect of partial protection, even in areas where spearfishing was prohibited. Fully protected zones supported more than three times the biomass of highly targeted coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) compared to open fishing zones, and more than twice the biomass observed in partially protected zones. Similar outcomes occurred for primary targets collectively; conversely, there were no zoning-related differences for non-target fishes. Structural complexity was a consistent positive driver of fish biomass for all fish groups and among all zones. Notably high target fish biomass occurred at NTMR sites with the highest structural complexity, highlighting the importance of both habitat and protection in supporting population hotspots for targeted reef fishes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Coral Reef Society (ICRS).","Coral reef habitats; Coral trout; Fisheries management; Fishing; Marine protected areas structural complexity","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145501886"

Geological, physiographic, edaphological, vegetation cover, and land use potential characteristics, were analyzed. Three Ecological Protection and Risk Zones were identified, with the largest extension of the PPF corresponding to lands of very high and high vulnerability and high ecological risk, which include >85% of Protected Natural Areas (PNA) and 54% of the Buffer Zone (BZ). Moderate risk areas represent 30% of the Buffer Zone (BZ) and 13% of the PNA, and the low-risk areas (represent 15% of the BZ and 2% of the PNA).

However, many MPAs are currently falling short of their intended objectives. Studies show that meaningful public engagement can assist in optimising the outcomes of an MPA by improving stakeholder knowledge, support, and social license, and thus improving voluntary compliance with local MPA regulations. Ensuring more meaningful engagement, however, requires a context specific understanding of how different stakeholder groups understand the MPA, how they acquire that knowledge, and how information delivery can be tailored more effectively to reach the target audience. To that end, this study employed a quantitative survey to explore stakeholder awareness and knowledge of the Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP), a multi-use marine park on the west Australian coastline. Specifically, we surveyed visitors (i.e., tourists) to the Ningaloo region to understand their awareness of the NMP, their knowledge of the marine zoning regulations, and their access to information (N = 169). Results suggest that visitors to the region exhibit low levels of awareness of the primary management bodies, and of the presence of zoning regulations in the NMP. There was also a significant gap in the perceived level of protection afforded by the NMP compared to the actual protection, with visitors believing that the MPA provides more protection of the marine environment than it does in practice. These findings highlight a need for future regional communication strategies to be focused on improving the overall awareness and knowledge of the NMP among visitors through clear, consistent and accessible information. Specifically, visitors indicated that moving forwards, they would like to access this information through visitor centres, on local signage and on websites. The results of this study provide valuable insights for local marine park managers and decision-makers to improve existing communication strategies in order to maximise the ecological, social and economic outcomes of the NMP. These insights also have a wider application for improving ongoing public engagement with MPAs globally, which is particularly important given the rapid designation of MPAs to meet the global target of 30% of global oceans protected by 2030. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Communication; Engagement; Marine protected area; Perceptions; Tourist","Australia; Ningaloo Coast; Ningaloo Marine Park; Western Australia; Conservation; Decision making; Environmental protection; Surveys; Australia; Communication strategy; Engagement; Key policies; Marine park; Marine protected area; Ningaloo; Policy instruments; Public engagement; Tourist; coastal protection; communication; compliance; environmental policy; knowledge; marine environment; marine park; perception; protected area; stakeholder; tourist attraction; Zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134434447"

Therefore, Landscape proves a suitable concept both for the enhancement of cultural features and for nature conservation. The aim of this work is to apply the landscape approach to the Pantelleria National Park, providing the opportunity to reflect upon and discuss whether and how to encompass rural landscape planning and management within the broader context of natural values, offering a frame of reference for the zoning of the future Park Plan. Specifically, the research aims to define zoning categories, typical to protected areas planning, using criteria related to landscape features and patterns, environmental quality, traditional agriculture, architectural heritage. Established in 2016, the Pantelleria National Park is the most recent Italian National Park and the first one in Sicily. The Park covers 79% of the island, encompassing two sites of Community Importance as well as one Special Protection Area belonging to the Natura 2000 network. Pantelleria is a microcosm gathering a great variety of natural and human-made landscapes characterized by high levels of complexity embodying the antagonism of two protected ‘noble interests’: Nature and the environment on the one hand, Culture framed as traditional rural practices on the other. The main challenge of the new-founded National Park is to combine quality and values relating to the domain of Nature, which is expanding, with those expressed by Culture, represented by a wide array of historical rural values at risk due to ongoing abandonment of most remote areas. © 2021 by the authors.

Information about the links between zoning and ecosystem services (ES) is lacking, particularly in terms of the relative roles of natural contributions (ecosystem properties and functions) and anthropogenic contributions (human inputs such as technology and infrastructure) in coproducing ES. This study aimed to: (1) analyse how coproduction of four ES (crop production, grazing, timber production, recreation) differs across the three zones of BRs; and (2) understand which predictors (zoning, natural and anthropogenic contributions, other environmental characteristics) best explain ES provision within BRs. To do this, we collected spatial data on 137 terrestrial BRs in the European Union and on 16 indicators of ES coproduction. We used non-parametric pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum tests to calculate differences in indicators between zones. We used model selection and multiple linear regression to identify predictors of ES provision patterns. Anthropogenic contributions showed most differences between zones, with contributions generally increasing from buffer zones to transition areas. Natural contributions did not, on average, differ between zones, however, for recreation and crop production they decreased from buffer zones to transition areas. ES provision differed between zones only for crop production and grazing, which increased from buffer zones to transition areas. Regression analysis showed that natural contributions are the best predictors of ES provision for all four services. Our results indicate that zoning of BRs has implications for ES coproduction. © 2021 The Author(s).

Habitat protection, however, is rarely followed by habitat monitoring; consequently, knowledge about the efficacy of zoning as a species conservation tool is limited. We used a time series of Landsat satellite imagery (1975–2007) to quantify habitat changes in and adjacent to 187 areas zoned on private, commercial forestlands to protect habitat for wintering white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Maine. Near the northern edge of their geographic range where snow can restrict mobility and access to forage, white-tailed deer depend on mature conifer forests as wintering habitat. Our primary objective was to evaluate effectiveness of land-use zoning to conserve and prevent fragmentation of mature conifer forest. Between 1975 and 2007, the incidence rate of timber harvesting in zoned areas was high (97%). Cumulative area harvested (25%) and the associated reduction of mature conifer forest (13%) that resulted from stand-replacing harvests were considerably lower in zoned areas, indicating that regulations were successful at limiting timber harvests within zones. Reduction of mature conifer forest within unzoned 2-km buffers surrounding protected areas was considerably higher (45%). Remaining patches of mature conifer forest became increasingly fragmented, with a greater than 3-fold increase in number of patches and greater than 80% reduction in mean patch area. Regenerating forest increased from 5% to 36% in the landscapes surrounding zones, and although it can offer important browse, travel across young forest is costly for deer during periods of deep snow. Circa 2007, approximately 55% of the mature conifer forest present across our study area in 1975 remained, and our results suggest that less than 50% of the regenerating areas harvested in mature conifer forest will return to conifer dominance. Forest type conversion will, thus, extend effects of habitat fragmentation into the future. Areas protected for wintering deer collectively represent only 2% of the forested land base in our study area, and we conclude that habitat protection focused solely on those narrowly-defined zones has been ineffective at achieving regional conservation of winter habitat for deer. This study demonstrates how remote sensing can be used to overcome the difficulty of monitoring protected forest areas, and exemplifies the need for monitoring to understand the long-term benefits of zoning as a means of wildlife habitat conservation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Conifer forest; Habitat conservation; Landscape change; White-tailed deer; Zoning","Conservation; Ecosystems; Harvesting; Land Use; Remote Sensing; Snow; Maine; United States; Cervidae; Coniferophyta; Odocoileus virginianus; Conservation; Ecosystems; Harvesting; Land use; Logging (forestry); Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Snow; Timber; Zoning; Conifer forests; Geographic ranges; Habitat conservation; Habitat fragmentation; Habitat monitoring; Landscape changes; Species conservations; White-tailed deer; coniferous forest; deer; habitat conservation; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; Landsat; landscape change; regeneration; satellite imagery; timber harvesting; time series; zoning policy; Reforestation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047840843"

The general approaches lack the ability to simulate the farmlands’ production potential under different scenarios. This paper proposes a modified farmland protection zoning framework to demarcate farmland protection by coupling the Agro-Ecological Zone (AEZ) model with a state-of-the-art farmland protection zoning framework. The modified zoning framework was applied to China, a typical fast developing country. The results indicated that the average potential production of the entire country would increase by 2.96 % in the coming decade if the irrigation efficiency criteria of 55 % established by the National Program for Agricultural Water Conservation (2012–2020) can be fulfilled. Furthermore, the farmland protection area could also be reduced by 2.91 % (2.96 million ha) while the total production potential of the protected areas would remain unchanged. This study contributes two main aspects: (1) The AEZ model was used as a replacement for the general land-use suitability analysis (LUSA) or multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) based farmland assessment models in a farmland zoning framework, which can accurately assess the production potential of the farmland protection demarcation.

Ecological importance and tenacity were proposed in this study for the island protected area zoning. The ecological importance was composed of three components, namely, landscape, soil, and vegetation; the ecological tenacity was evaluated based on the ecological importance and considering three types of influences, i.e., anthropogenic, topographic, and marine influences. Two new indices, namely, ecological importance index (EII) and ecological tenacity index (ETI), were established, and remote sensing and field data were integrated to serve as the data source and realize the spatial exhibitions. Then, the island protected area zoning was conducted based on the spatial distributions of EII and ETI, and six schemes for different protection and development purposes were designed. An island chain in Dongtou Archipelago in South China was used as the study area. Results indicated that the ecological importance and tenacity showed spatial heterogeneities across islands and within the islands. The islands with higher proximities to the mainland and larger areas generally possessed lower ecological importance and tenacity. Of the six schemes, Scheme B was the recommended scheme because of its reasonable area assignments for different protected areas, the optimum compatibility with island uses, and the balance of protection and development. The demonstration of the method validated the advantages of the EII and ETI in revealing the spatial characteristics of island ecological importance and tenacity, as well as the effectiveness of the method in the island protected area zoning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological importance; Ecological tenacity; Island; Protected area zoning; Spatial heterogeneity; Sustainable development","China; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecology; Planning; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Tenacity; Zoning; Ecological importance; Importance index; Island; Island chains; Protected areas; Spatial characteristics; Spatial heterogeneity; Three component; biodiversity; ecological approach; environmental protection; heterogeneity; island biogeography; landscape ecology; protected area; remote sensing; spatial analysis; sustainable development; Environmental protection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078914377"

This study aimed to evaluate management systems and extractivist areas and related ethnoecological knowledge of Dimorphandra gardneriana (fava d’anta) in the semiarid region of Ceará, Northeast of Brazil. Fava d’anta produces fruits with high concentration of bioflavonoids, substances with various pharmacological properties, being exploited by extractivist communities in the mosaic of protected areas in Chapada do Araripe, Ceará. Ethnoecological knowledge has been concentrated on collectors who have been in activity for a longer time and/or plant the species. We identified three management systems that can impact in different ways on fava d’anta populations, depending on the area and level of human interference with the species. The extractivists respect the zoning of protected areas and do not enter in the full protection area, choosing areas with the highest tree density. The different systems produce a mosaic that creates different extraction opportunities and modifications to the local landscape and to fava d’anta populations. Factors that may have effects on the conservation of the species are the lack of supervision and overexploitation of the resource in native areas, while the factors that affect the health of extractivists are the infrastructure of the work and exposure to wild environments. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Conservation unit; Extractivism; Participatory mapping; Traditional ecological knowledge","Brazil; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ethnobotany; Fabaceae; Forests; Humans; Trees; Brazil; Ceara; Chapada do Araripe; Dimorphandra; Arid regions; Data mining; Environmental protection; Plants (botany); Conservation strategies; Conservation units; Extractivism; Human interference; Non-timber forest products; Northeastern Brazil; Pharmacological properties; Traditional ecological knowledge; conservation management; ethnobotany; exploitation; habitat mosaic; knowledge; management practice; mapping method; participatory approach; protected area; semiarid region; traditional knowledge; wild population; Article; Brazil; demography; Dimorphandra gardneriana; environmental management; environmental protection; ethnobotany; Fabaceae; nonhuman; plantation; pollination; species habitat; structured questionnaire; zonation; forest; human; tree; Conservation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078226153"

However, at the policy-relevant scale of protected areas, we know little about how the spatial distribution of prey depletion affects carnivore space use and population persistence. We developed a spatially explicit, agent-based model to investigate the effects of different human-induced prey depletion experiments on the globally endangered tiger (Panthera tigris) in isolated protected areas—a situation that prevails throughout the tiger's range. Specifically, we generated 120 experiments that varied the spatial extent and intensity of prey depletion across a stylized (circle) landscape (1,000 km2) and Nepal's Chitwan National Park (~1,239 km2). Experiments that created more spatially homogenous prey distributions (i.e., less prey removed per cell but over larger areas) resulted in larger tiger territories and smaller population sizes over time. Counterintuitively, we found that depleting prey along the edge of Chitwan National Park, while decreasing tiger numbers overall, also decreased female competition for those areas, leading to lower rates of female starvation. Overall our results suggest that subtle differences in the spatial distributions of prey densities created by various human activities, such as natural resource-use patterns, urban growth and infrastructure development, or conservation spatial zoning might have unintended, detrimental effects on carnivore populations. Our model is a useful planning tool as it incorporates information on animal behavioral ecology, resource spatial distribution, and the drivers of change to those resources, such as human activities. © 2019 The Authors.

Due to this, it is convenient to evaluate the importance of the criteria for biodiversity conservation through a general assessment, which could establish relevant criteria that can be analysed through geostatistical methods combined in multicriteria analysis. This paper aims to consider biodiversity importance values taking into account land use, so that it is possible to develop a zoning proposal which verifies or corrects the suitability of the designated areas for the Natura 2000 Network in Castilla y León, Andalucía and Madrid (Spain). The choice of these regions allows us to compare areas with a high variability of population density, making possible to compare the potential protected areas with respect to the population living in each area. This assessment has been performed using basic and easily adaptable criteria of biodiversity conservation, so it could be applied in other European territories. In this way, clear and uniform parameters for zoning will be used, being possible to detect the best protected areas. One of the most important purposes of the Natura 2000 Network is to increase connectivity between territories; our work proposes new areas that could be linked to currently protected territories, to favour the achievement of this purpose of the Natura 2000 Network. © 2019 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Conservation; Land use; Natura 2000; Zoning","Castile; Madrid [Spain]; Spain; biodiversity; connectivity; European Union; geostatistics; land use; multicriteria analysis; population density; protected area; zoning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059985829"

The present study investigated the short-term effects of tourist presence on the behaviour of spinner dolphins at Sha'ab Samadai (Samadai Reef), in the southern Egyptian Red Sea. The reef has a large central lagoon where a population of spinner dolphin regularly rest from mid-morning to mid-afternoon; visitors are permitted to snorkel in the southern part of the lagoon, but not in the northern closed zone that the dolphins mainly use. Dolphin behaviour was monitored both on days when tourist boats were present and on days when they were absent. In the presence of tourists the proportion of time that the dolphins spent resting was reduced by two-thirds, whereas the times spent milling, travelling, and showing avoidance behaviour all increased. Furthermore, upon using Markov chain modelling to investigate the effect of tourist presence on the transition probabilities between dolphin activity states, significant changes were found in 10 of the 25 possible behavioural transitions, including increased probabilities of transitioning from resting to milling or travelling, from milling to travelling or avoiding, and from travelling to avoiding. These findings raise concerns that despite the management measures in place, tourist activities affect the dolphins’ behaviour to a greater extent than was previously apparent, with potential long-term negative effects on their energy budget. The study led to proposals for amending the zoning of the site and for strengthening the regulations for tourist vessels. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","coral; lagoon; mammals; marine protected areas; ocean; protected species; recreation; rural development","Egypt; Red Sea [(GVR) Egypt]; Samadai Reef; Anthozoa; Mammalia; Stenella (Cetacea); Stenella longirostris; activity pattern; avoidance reaction; behavioral response; dolphin; lagoon; tourism","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085894968"

Historically, the region has been continuously affected by meteorological phenomena, such as mass movement in the highland and floods in the lowland, which affected cities, communities and production activities year after year and led to the loss and deterioration of the ecosystems. To handle this problem, a proposal for environmental planning is suggested. The final objective is to provide key information that concerns the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals, particularly related to the protection and restoration of forest areas. In this study, spatial analysis and modeling were applied to map homogeneous units for environmental planning in the Mexico-Guatemala trans-border region. Additionally, forest area as a proportion of the total land area, its share inside the natural protected areas and distribution by ecosystem type were calculated for 2010 and 2019. From the data analysis it was found that the total forest area in the region has decreased from 47% in 2010 to 43 % in 2019; 27% and 25% of the total area, respectively, correspond to forests within the natural protected areas. The principal ecosystem type in the Natural Protected Areas corresponds to tropical forest. Two conclusions can be drawn, that agroforestry zoning is an important tool to monitor forest areas in the context of achieving Sustainable Development Goals and that the natural protected areas play a fundamental role in the preservation of the forest in the region. © 2021, Russian Geographical Society.

National park planning should aim to achieve conservation goals, leam from nature reserve zoning and itemize management objectives for sub-zoning, and learn from scenic area planning to take a landscapce value into consideration and balance socio-economic conditions, especially land tenure. It then should consider climate change and regional development goals in the long term to finalize the theoretical system. In the formation of the theory, realizing different ecosystem service bundles could be the target of spatial control. Under certain land tenure systems, ecological protection and community livelihood development could be balanced by implementing conservation easements to separate land ownership, use rights, and benefit rights to restrain community land use in certain areas with compensation. © 2019 Science Press.

We applied a systematic conservation planning tool, Marxan with Zones, and stakeholder consultation to design and revise the draft zoning plan. This process was facilitated by Sabah Parks, a government agency, and WWF-Malaysia, under the guidance of the Tun Mustapha Park steering committee and with support from the University of Queensland. Four conservation and fishing zones, including no-take areas, were developed, each with representation and replication targets for key marine habitats, and a range of socio-economic and community objectives. Here we report on how decision-support tools informed the reserve design process in three planning stages: prioritization, government review, and community consultation. Using marine habitat and species representation as a reporting metric, we describe how the zoning plan changed at each stage of the design process. We found that the changes made to the zoning plan by the government and stakeholders resulted in plans that compromised the achievement of conservation targets because no-take areas were moved away from villages and the coastline, where unique habitats are located. The design process highlights a number of lessons learned for future conservation zoning, which we believe will be useful as many other places embark on similar zoning processes on land and in the sea.

The PFE can have several different land-use zones based on different purposes. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of the PFE in reducing deforestation using country-scale datasets of forest cover change between 2006 and 2017 in Myanmar. We also evaluated the effectiveness of PFE land-use zones such as protected areas (PAs) and production forests in reducing deforestation. The effectiveness was analysed using propensity score matching to minimize the effect of the non-random distribution of the PFE and specific land-use zoning. The results showed that the PFE significantly reduced deforestation compared to non-PFE areas. Within the PFE, both PAs and production forests had lower deforestation than non-PFE. However, both the PFE and non-PFE showed an increased trend of annual deforestation between 2006 and 2017. Production forests also showed an increased trend of annual deforestation although PAs did not. We concluded that the PFE, PAs and production forests are effective in reducing deforestation. However, in Myanmar, further efforts should be undertaken to mitigate the increase of deforestation in the PFE, especially in production forests. © 2020 The Japanese Forest Society.","Avoided deforestation; land-use zones; permanent forest estate; propensity score matching; spill-overs","Conservation; Coverings; Deforestation; Distribution; Forests; Land Use; Matching; Production; Myanmar; Conservation; Deforestation; Zoning; Avoided deforestation; Forest cover change; Forest estate; Land use zoning; Land-use zone; Myanmars; Permanent forest estate; Propensity score matching; Protected areas; Spill over; data set; deforestation; forest cover; forestry production; land use change; spillover effect; Land use","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089857070"

The existing BRs have worked with local people to create culture landscapes and conserve natural resources. The ideal BR models for areas undergoing climate change are cities within nature, and the areas that can be designated as BRs have natural and cultural landscapes. BRs comprise three areas, the core, buffer, and transition, in order to efficiently perform three functions, which are conservation, development, and logistical support. A transition area is where people earn an income from local businesses while effectively preserving their natural surroundings. When this area has a role in meeting the communal goals of residents by providing local resources and landscapes, it is appropriately managed and maintained. In addition, local products produced in BRs, which UNESCO believes are generated in excellent ecosystems, can be sold under the BR brand, contributing to residents' incomes and local image. The Baekdudaegan mountain range (BDDG) is traditionally cherished as a symbol of the Korean peninsula and has enormous scientific value as an ecological repository. Additionally, the BDDG is considered a unique geographical recognition system referred to as sanjabunsuryung by the local area districts where Korean people have lived following a unique religious and historical culture. This study categorized types of transition areas in targeted areas with high potential for designation as a BR based on geographical characteristics. The developed index was supported by the Analytical Hierarchy Process method proposed by experts, and zoning of the BR was performed. Among the areas of the BR, the transition area was the focus of this study. This area was classified into three types, which were then subdivided. The watershed types were self-managed, neighborhood, and cooperative; the resident types were urban, relatively rural, and rural; and the local resources types were natural-scenery and historical-cultural. A management plan is suggested regarding administrative districts, an urban BR, and relationships to other protected areas in the BDDG. In conclusion, the transition area of the BR was recognized as urban via the categorization process, and management of the BDDG should take a long-term approach. © SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.","Baekdudaegan mountain range (BDDG); Biosphere reserves (BRs); Transition area; Urban BR and sanjabunsuryung","Baekdudaegan; biosphere; climate change; conservation management; cultural landscape; nature conservation; protected area","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065040207"

The compromise is often difficult to reach, which causes conflicts over the management priorities of existing and potential protected areas. Ecosystem services (ES) perspective offers a promising avenue for diagnosing and reconciling contrasting interests concerning the use of benefits from ecosystems. We examined how the spatial proximity to the Białowieża Forest (BF), a European biodiversity hotspot, affects the perceived use of ES by local communities. We performed a survey among 719 respondents from 35 villages situated within BF and in its vicinity. We found that both the declared use of ES and the perceived influence of ES on household's economy was declining with the distance from BF with particularly high differences between areas not further than 3 km from BF and areas located 3-15 km from BF. Different zones varied in terms of benefits from tourism and costs connected with a potential limited access to ES due to conservation. Broadening the perspective, we argue that the trade-offs linked to ES may vary depending on the location in relation to the protected area and that local communities should not be treated as a homogenous group when considering benefits from the forest. Awareness of common patterns of ES use over space and local specificity may enhance effective management of even highly contested conservation areas. © 2020 The Authors","Biodiversity conservation; Conservation; Ecosystem services; Local resource use; Management; National park; Natura 2000; Perceptions; Planning; Protected areas; Spatial analysis; Tourism; Zoning","biodiversity; ecosystem service; environmental protection; forest management; nature conservation; protected area","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086025672"

This study combines literature review methods and spatial analysis to determine the time series of forest land cover change between 2009, 2014, and 2019 by analyzing LULCC in the Upper Citarum Watershed. This study indicates that the time series of forest land cover in the Upper Citarum Watershed has undergone a significant change. Forest increased by 4.63% between 2009 and 2014, and by 32.19% between 2014 and 2019. Based on the mandate of Law no. 41 of 1999 concerning Forestry, the area of forest that must be maintained is at least 30% (thirty percent) of the area of watershed and/or islands with a proportional distribution. With the forest area of 23.61% of the Upper Citarum Watershed, the existing condition has not yet reached the target.

In social-ecological systems based on traditional rural activities and associated with protected areas, this balance is particularly complex. Quantifying the economic impact of land use changes on ecosystem services can be useful to advise policy makers and improving social-ecological sustainability. In this study, we evaluated the land use changes in a time series and estimated the monetary value of the ecosystem services of the Urdaibai Biosphere Reserve (Biscay, Spain). In addition, we linked the monetary and biophysical values of land uses in each zoning units of the reserve, in order to identify the spatial adjustment between both assessments. Results showed that land use changes have clearly homogenized the landscape without substantially affecting its economic value. The methodological approach allowed detection that the reserve zoning was performed based more on its biophysical values than on economic ones. Thus, evident divergences between the biophysical and economic assessments were found. The core area was the one that had the highest coincidences (medium values) between both ecosystem services assessments, which highlights its importance not only in biophysical terms, is also economical.

Unfortunately, the fisheries condition has continued to decline in the past decades, where the rate of exploitation of capture fisheries in Jor Bay shows an unbalanced condition because the harvest value is still higher than the recruitments and growth. Awiq-Awiq regulates all existing utilization and protection of marine resources, but yet, has not included spatial aspects, leaving a situation that leads to unsustainability for fisheries resources and other resources. Balanced zoning of ecosystems and marine resources is needed in order to ensure the sustainability of the fisheries system in Jor Bay. This paper aims to illustrate how a marine spatial planning approach in a local MPA can be built with a community-based zoning system. The integration of local systems and formal-government systems is very effective and fast in the development of MPA zoning systems by considering the optimum allocation of the existence of ecosystems that guarantee the natural metabolic processes of the fisheries system in the Bay. The implementation of the MPA zoning system is expected to be able to support the guarantee of sustainable fisheries production for the surrounding region. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Conservation; Ecosystems; Marine biology; Meats; Oceanography; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Zoning; Government systems; Marine conservations; Marine protected area; Marine Spatial Planning; Optimum allocation; Surrounding regions; Sustainable fishery; Unbalanced condition; Fisheries","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078984752"

The classification of ecological space has always been a hot issue in the ecological management and plays an important role in promoting the sustainable development of urban agglomeration. This paper takes the urban agglomeration of Pearl River Delta as an example, based on the policy goals, public preferences, and expert knowledge of urban agglomeration to comprehensively construct the evaluation system. The initial study of the ecological space management zoning was conducted on the basis of the evaluation of the ecological space quality and ecosystem health. The results showed that the ecological space accounted for 82.8% of the area of the urban agglomeration. The quality of the ecological space was good, but the level of the ecosystem health was low. At the urban scale, the ecological space quality of Zhaoqing and Shenzhen was higher, that of Zhuhai and Zhongshan was lower; the ecosystem health of Huizhou and Zhaoqing was higher, that of Foshan and Zhongshan was lower. Integrated with the quality of ecological space and ecosystem health, the ecological space was divided into key protection area, key restoration area, potential restoration area, and ecological conservation area at the regional scale. The key protected areas accounted for 10. 1%, which were the regional ecological source areas. The strictest environmental protection system should be implemented, ecological red line and nature protected area should be delimited, strengthen ecological construction and biodiversity protection, also the construction of ecological connectivity should be strengthened to improve the overall regional ecosystem services. The key restoration areas accounted for 21.6%, mainly focusing on ecological restoration, implementation of ecological projects, and promotion of ecological industry. The potential restoration areas account for 13.1%, mainly focusing on protection and natural recovery, comprehensive conservation and protection and improve the quality of ecological space, and focus on improving the function of ecosystem service. The ecological conservation area account for 55.2%, mainly focusing on ecological corridor construction, strengthening the construction of high standard farmland, and protecting the basis of ecological space. Therefore, the production and construction activities should be carried out reasonably. In this paper, the research on the ecological space zoning could facilitate the decision makers to identify and classify the ecological restoration space and the ecological protection space, and could effectively guide the improvement of the land space planning and the regional ecological environment management system. © 2021 Science Press.

Methods: Based on literature, we summarize the role of connectivity as one component of relevance in the broad structure of spatial prioritization in both marine and terrestrial realms. Results: Partially diffuse, directed connectivity can be approximated in Zonation-based multi-criteria SCP by applying hydrodynamic modelling, knowledge on species traits, and information on species occurrences and quality of habitats. Sources and destinations of larvae or propagules can be identified as separate spatial layers and taken into account in full-scale spatial prioritization involving data on biota, as well as economic factors, threats, and administrative constraints. While population connectivity is an important determinant of metapopulation persistence, the importance of marine connectivity depends on species traits and the marine environment studied. At one end of the continuum are species that occupy isolated habitats and have long pelagic larval durations in deeper sea areas with strong directional currents. At the other extreme are species with short pelagic durations that occupy fragmented habitats in shallow topographically complex sea areas with weak and variable currents. Conclusions: We conclude that the same objectives, methods, and analysis structures are applicable to both terrestrial and marine spatial prioritization. Marine spatial conservation planning, marine spatial planning, marine zoning, etc., can be implemented using methods originated in the terrestrial realm of planning. © 2020, The Author(s).","Ecosystem services; Marine connectivity; Marine spatial planning; Systematic conservation planning; Zonation software","connectivity; conservation planning; habitat management; hydrodynamics; marine policy; metapopulation; network design; protected area; restoration ecology; topography","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084670120"

The impact of scientists’ interaction with nature during their field researches is rarely ever discussed on literature. In this paper, we evaluate the externali-ties produced by scientific research on fauna based on a zoning system of a Man and Biosphere Reserve (MaB) in order to determine incompatibilities. We assume that the MaB zoning systems could prevent the generation of this type of waste done by scientists. We systematized all documents referred to Ñacuñán MaB Reserve in Argentina (60 years of records) and created a digital library. Afterward, we spatialized the investigations related to fauna and contrasted them with the current zoning system. The results showed that most of the researches were manipulatives and were conducted at the transition zone, followed by the northern core zone. Scientists do not always respect the activities allowed by zone. Sampling sites are frequently selected according to the proximity of their accommodation rather than to the permitted activities. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate new policies to avoid scientists’ liabilities and to encourage the build of knowledge and research on less studied zones, to promote conservation and sustainable development of MaB reserves. © 2021, Universidad de Granada.

In data-poor ecosystems conservation planning is informed by using environmental surrogates (e.g. temperature) predominantly in two ways: to develop habitat classification schemes (1) or develop species distribution models (2). We test the utility of both approaches for conservation planning of marine ecosystems, and rank environmental surrogates, such as depth and distance from shore, according to their power to predict the distribution and abundance of biotic species. Specifically, we compared a habitat classification scheme; based on coarse levels of habitat types derived from depth and distance from shore; against species distribution models, which predict fish abundance and prevalence as a function of environmental surrogates (depth, distance from shore, latitude, reef area, zoning, and several metrics of habitat structural complexity). We consistently set conservation target levels to 21% of each conservation feature, following global standards and a sensitivity analyses. Thus when running scenarios to protect fish species we aimed to protect at least 21% of each species, and when running scenarios of habitat classes, we aimed to protect at least 21% of each habitat class. We found that when aiming to protect 21% of the chosen conservation targets, distribution models protected 21% of the predicted abundance/occurrence of all modelled species and functional groups, but did not protect most habitats. Contrastingly, using a habitat classification scheme protected 21% of all habitat types and 34% of all species and functional groups, but required protecting three times more area. Thus, using only distribution models as targets in data-poor ecosystems could be a risky conservation planning strategy. Ultimately the best conservation outcomes were achieved by incorporating local knowledge to synthesize the conservation outcomes of both scenarios. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation planning; Conservation prioritization; Data-deficient ecosystems; Ecological and functional surrogates; Endemic and threatened species; Fish; Habitat classification scheme; Habitat maps; Local knowledge and expertise; Marine protected areas; Marxan; Spatial management; Stakeholders","abundance; conservation planning; ecological modeling; endangered species; endemic species; fish; functional group; habitat type; map; marine ecosystem; marine park; population distribution; prioritization; protected area; spatial planning; species occurrence; stakeholder; strategic approach; traditional knowledge","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049313902"

Almost half of all deforested areas in the region (36,060 km2) are considered a global restoration hotspot, however secondary vegetation remains unprotected and 8,294 km2 were cleared between 2014 and 2018. Due to uncontrolled deforestation and fragmentation, Maranhão has no more forest core areas (outside protected areas) with the minimum size to ensure sustainable forest management practices for timber production. New policies at the state level must promote old-growth and secondary forest conservation and restoration. However, the trends point to the opposite direction: the Ecological-Economic Zoning (ZEE) allows the reduction of forest protection and the State Forest Policy reinforces federal legislation setbacks.

However, land managers of most protected areas can barely identify whether the zones they manage are ideally designated due to lack of clear information related to the protected objects as well as other related in-situ conservation information on a regional scale. Here we focused on 26 protected areas at national and local levels that have mainly been designated to protect the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in Sichuan Province, China. The management zones of these protected areas included core, buffer, and experiment zones. We used five indicators to test the spatial differentiation among management zones, including the area of each management zone (Area), the proportion of a zone that overlapped with other protected areas (Overlap proportion), the number of giant pandas present (Panda number), the density of giant pandas (Panda density), and the proportion of the concentrated distribution areas for giant panda (CDA proportion). The results showed that Area and Panda number of the core zone were significantly higher than the buffer zone (P = 0.000) and the experiment zone (0.000 ≤ P ≤ 0.001); Panda density in the core zone (P = 0.006) and buffer zone (P = 0.009) were significantly higher than in the experiment zone. Meanwhile, the buffer zone had the highest Panda density (7.71 individuals/100 km2) and the experiment zone had the highest CDA proportion (42.19%). Nevertheless, no significant differences were observed in the five indicators between the national and local protected areas (0.058 ≤ P ≤ 1). The concentrated distribution area for giant panda accounted for 36.66% of these 26 protected areas, covering nearly 80% of the population of wild giant pandas, while the previous core zones (accounting for 62.84% of the 26 protected areas) only covered 66.12% of the population of wild giant pandas. Thus, we suggested that the concentrated distribution area of giant panda should be designated as the main area of the functional zone and be designated mainly for conserving biodiversity that is represented by giant panda in the Sichuan area of Giant Panda National Park; in addition, the local protected areas should be given more attention during the reform of China's protected area system. © 2020 The Authors","Endemic species; Management zone; National park; Nature reserve; Protection efficiency; Sichuan","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098230092"

Cyclone-induced storm surges cause severe damage to these polders by overtopping and breaching the dikes. A total of 19 major tropical storms have hit the coast in the last 50 years, and the storm frequency is likely to increase due to climate change. The present paper presents an investigation of the inundation pattern in a protected area behind dikes due to floods caused by storm surges and identifies possible critical locations of dike breaches. Polder 48 in the coastal region, also known as Kuakata, was selected as the study area. A HEC-RAS 1-D-2-D hydrodynamic model was developed to simulate inundation of the polder under different scenarios. Scenarios were developed by considering tidal variations, the angle of the cyclone at landfall, possible dike breach locations and sea level rise due to climate change according to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). A storm surge for a cyclone event with a 1-in-25-year return period was considered for all the scenarios. The primary objective of this research was to present a methodology for identifying the critical location of dike breaching, generating a flood risk map (FRM) and a probabilistic flood map (PFM) for the breaching of dikes during a cyclone. The critical location of the dike breach among the chosen possible locations was identified by comparing the inundation extent and damage due to flooding corresponding to the developed scenarios. A FRM corresponding to the breaching in the critical location was developed, which indicated that settlements adjacent to the canals in the polders were exposed to higher risk. A PFM was developed using the simulation results corresponding to the developed scenarios, which was used to recommend the need of appropriate land use zoning to minimize the vulnerability to flooding. The developed hydrodynamic model can be used to forecast inundation, to identify critical locations of the dike requiring maintenance and to study the effect of climate change on flood inundation in the study area.</p> The frequency and intensity of the cyclones around the world are likely to increase due to climate change, which will require resource-intensive improvement of existing or new protection structures for the deltas. The identification and prioritization of the maintenance of critical locations of dike breaching can potentially prevent a disaster. The use of non-structural tools such as land use zoning with the help of flood risk maps and probabilistic flood maps has the potential to reduce risk and damage.

We assembled the experiences of MPA representatives from government agencies, non-government organisations, academia and industry (in the form of commissioned written book chapters) to describe various aspects of MPAs in Australia, from the history, successes and challenges in creating jurisdictional networks, to the science, economics and legal aspects of Australian MPA networks, to different sectoral perspectives. Key themes are discussed and include: 1) Marine protected areas are always contested (at first), 2) Jurisdiction-wide network declaration versus single MPA declarations, each have pros and cons, 3) For federal systems of government, coordination between the jurisdictions is important, 4) Fishery reserves as the first MPAs ‘muddy the waters’ for the objectives of modern MPAs, 5) A multitude of categories and zones and uses has also confused the MPA concept, 6) Multi-use versus no take: proving the benefits and the need for clear targets for each type, 7) Acknowledging the gap between pure science and realpolitik in the placement of MPAs, 8) Involvement of Indigenous communities in MPAs has been slower than for terrestrial protected areas but improving.

This study aimed to develop a forest fire risk zoning map for the Vila Velha State Park and its surroundings (Ponta Grossa, Paraná State, Brazil), for the period of higher incidence of forest fires (from April to September) and for the period of lower incidence (from October to March). The following risk and hazard variables were identified: human presence, usage zones, topographical features, soil coverage and land use and meteorological conditions. Coefficients (0 to 5) reflecting the fire risk or hazard degree were allocated to each variable in order to construct the maps. The integration of these maps, through a weighting model, resulted in the final risk mapping. The very high and extreme risk classes represented about 38% of the area for both periods.

We reviewed the literature and unpublished information on larval transport modeling, reef fish spawning aggregations, and marine protected area (MPA) management to identify alternatives for Cuban spawning site conservation. Larval transport information is available at annual and decadal scales for eight Cuban sites for five species of snappers. Connectivity patterns were examined: (a) within Cuban regions, (b) among Cuban regions, and (c) among other countries. We compared this information with the distribution of protected areas relative to spawning sites, site management attributes, and potential alternatives. Of eight focal spawning sites, seven are in protected areas and one is proposed. Southeast and north-central Cuba had highest estimated within-region retention levels. Southwest and northwest sites exported relatively more larvae out-of-region. Southern regions produced larvae that reached Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Haiti. All northern regions can export larvae to the southern Bahamas. The regions and sites within are geomorphologically diverse with variable fishing and socio-economic attributes. Information on stock status and protected area efficacy is limited and field assessments of aggregation status are needed for multispecies spawning sites. Few management plans address spawning conservation or network connectivity opportunities for MPAs. An alternative is development of one or more regional workgroups of protected area specialists, fishery scientists, expert fishers, and other stakeholders. Temporal closures of fisheries before and during spawning season could also amplify effectiveness of current gear- and zoning-based management tools. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","connectivity; Cuba; larval transport; Lutjanidae; MPA; snapper; spawning aggregation","Bahamas; Cayman Islands; Cuba; Haiti; Hispaniola; Jamaica; Lutjanidae; aggregation behavior; biophysics; connectivity; conservation management; fishery management; fishing; fishing gear; larval transport; marine environment; migration; perciform; protected area; reef; socioeconomic conditions; spawning; stakeholder; stock assessment","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052829461"

In December 2016, the TNP MPA was rezoned from 'no-take' to a partially open MPA to provide access for local fishing communities. Here, we examine the different values and beliefs that influence how diverse stakeholders perceive the rezoning process and the subsequent implications for marine conservation. Our research draws on 55 semi-structured key informant interviews (e.g., with communities, scientists, government), as well as a focus group with managers and staff from the South African conservation management authority. Results highlight the conditions through which values and beliefs about the MPA and the zoning effort have been mediated: 1) the historic (i.e., Apartheid) context in which the TNP MPA was created; 2) the disciplinary background, knowledge and lived experience of those involved in the rezoning; and 3) the underlying socio-economic circumstances that affect values and beliefs. Our research also reveals the entrenched perceptions (positive and negative) about the socio-cultural, ecological, regulatory and governance outcomes of rezoning. Ultimately, more collaborative efforts are necessary to reconcile diverse values and beliefs among different stakeholders, and to balance community rights with conservation rezoning objectives. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

These conflicts are typically most intense in human-dominated systems where people, livestock and wildlife share the same landscapes and during severe droughts. Consequently, HWC are common in developing countries where wildlife still roam outside protected areas, such as in parts of Africa. We analyze how HWC vary across multiple wildlife species, seasons, years, and regions to quantify their extent, causes and consequences using data collected by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS)in Narok County of Kenya during 2001–2017. Wildlife species contributed differentially to HWC such that only six species plus non-human primates contributed 90% of all the conflict incidents (n = 13,848)in the 17-year period. Specifically, the elephant (46.2%), buffalo (10.6%), Burchell's zebra (7.6%), leopard (7.3%), spotted hyena (5.8%)and lion (3.3%), collectively contributed 80.8%, whereas non-human primates contributed 11.7% of all the conflicts. The three most common conflict types were crop raiding (50.0%), attacks on humans (27.3%)and livestock depredation (17.6%). Crop raiding was most acute where cereals (wheat and maize)are grown on large scales. Carnivores were more likely to attack livestock species with body sizes comparable to their own. Thus, the leopard (44.0%, n = 3,368)and spotted hyena (37.9%, n = 2,903)killed most sheep and goats whereas the lion (63.1%, n = 531)and spotted hyenas (14.5%, n = 122)killed most cattle. HWC showed evident seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations, reflecting underlying rainfall variation. Accordingly, HWC were highest in 2008–2009 when rainfall was lowest in Narok County. Similarly, crop raiding peaked in the late wet season when crops mature whereas livestock depredation was higher in the wet season when natural prey density is lowest. Land conversion to agriculture and increase in human and livestock numbers were all positively associated with increase in HWC. Effective strategies for reducing HWC should be multi-faceted and integrate variation in the intensity and type of HWC between species, regions, seasons and years. Such strategies should discourage habitat conversion but encourage regulating livestock density. Further, they should promote land use zoning to minimize contacts between people, livestock and wildlife; effective livestock herding methods and predator-proof livestock corrals to minimize livestock depredation and fencing farms at greater risk of crop destruction. © 2019 The Authors","Climate change; Human population growth; Human-wildlife conflicts; Land use change; Livestock density; Wildlife density","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065883319"

Many MPAs and related zoning initiatives are located adjacent to coastal communities that rely on marine and coastal resources for their livelihoods. Thus, processes of zoning must often address local use of natural resources which can be perceived by decision-makers and regulators as problematic. Our analysis highlights how conservation zoning intersects with the perception of diverse stakeholders regarding a range of governance dimensions, including: (1) levels of participation and compliance; (2) the clarity of zoning and conservation objectives; (3) livelihood impacts and benefits; (4) evidence of ecological and conservation benefits; and (5) the influence on sense of place. Pathways forward to address the challenges of governance associated with zoning include the importance of co-producing knowledge for more robust zoning outcomes, and situating zoning processes in a co-management context in which power and authority are more evenly distributed. © Copyright © 2020 Muhl, Esteves Dias and Armitage.","governance; marine protected areas; perceptions; rights; zoning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089418855"

The statutory zoning plan provides the primary integrating component that prohibits many threatening activities and manages the impacts of allowed human activities and competing uses by means of various zones, special management areas and other spatial management tools. How zoning is applied, however, has changed considerably since the first zoning plan was finalized in 1981. Today, zoning is applied in combination with other layers of marine spatial planning; the effective combination of these management tools provides the integrated approach, considered one of the best for managing a large marine protected area. The zoning plan provides the foundation for management of the GBR and is the fundamental component of the integrated marine spatial planning approach ensuring high levels of protection for significant areas of the GBR, while also allowing ecologically sustainable use. The paper outlines the legal and managerial contexts of zoning, providing 38 lessons that may be useful for marine zoning and ecosystem-based management elsewhere. It outlines aspects of zoning that have worked well in the GBR Marine Park and what has changed in the light of experience and changing contexts, and seeks to clarify various misconceptions about zoning and marine spatial planning. The integrated management approach in the GBR utilizes a variety of spatial planning tools, which complement the underlying zoning; some of these comprise statutory management layers (e.g. designated shipping areas, special management areas, plans of management, fishery management arrangements, Traditional Owner agreements, defence training areas); other layers are non-statutory (e.g. site plans).

Their importance is due to the fact that the geographical environment, being complex and comprehensive formation, has a strong impact on the development and preservation of ecosystems. At the same time, for the considered governance and spatial level, the consideration of these factors can be reduced to the assessment of environmental risks of anthropogenic impact on the coastal system and coastal infrastructure. All environmental factors can be divided into direct and indirect. Direct impact factors are those that have a direct impact on the environment and do not need to be subdivided into components. Such factors are air emissions, availability and area of protected areas and others. Indirect parameters are those assessment parameters through which it is possible to express the pressure on the environment, not directly showing the state of the environment, but having physical justification for this. For example, these factors are the density of the coastal population, economic costs allocated to environmental protection and others. The indicator approach, which combines different approaches to assessing the stability of coastal systems and coastal infrastructure, is widely recognized in the scientific works and studies of coastal systems. The indicator approach involves the use of various indicator systems to analyze and assess the state of sustainability and trends in coastal systems. The method was tested for the coastal district municipalities of the Murmansk region, resulting in a heterogeneous distribution of anthropogenic load depending on the types of impacts.

Shifting cultivation and other agricultural activities around the protected areas by rural communities often lead to increased carbon emissions, wildlife habitat destruction and increasing hunting pressure. Land use planning, with the participation of local communities in the buffer zones, is being considered to strengthen the implementation of the Man and the Biosphere Program at Crocker Range Park, Sabah, Malaysia. As part of the European Union's ‘Tackling Climate Change Through Sustainable Forest Management and Community Development’ program, we emphasized the participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) approach to support village-scale land use planning that considers the needs of multiple stakeholders in the community. The PGIS was applied within a multi-criteria framework to determine the location of a potential community conservation area (CCA) and to plan future land use activities in the village. Key informant interviews were followed by a participatory mapping workshop, attended by various stakeholders and experts, which was convened to discuss and elicit local knowledge to generate the environmental and resource indicators for determining potential land use activities within the village (e.g., agriculture, tourism and recreation, and forest restoration). Based on the discussions and spatial analyses, a land use zoning map with a potential CCA was presented at a follow-up land use decision making workshop. The villagers and external stakeholders reached a consensus on the land use zoning; leading to the designation process of the CCA. The PGIS-based land use planning has effectively supported the community forest conservation and is potentially applicable to other Southeast Asia regions with similar environmental and socio-economic settings. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Borneo; Community conservation area; Participatory conservation planning; REDD+","Malaysia; buffer zone; cultivation; European Union; forest management; GIS; land use planning; local participation; nature conservation; protected area; stakeholder","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072740445"

In this regard, zoning legitimately balances influential stakeholders versus weak ones, and can leverage stakeholders to exercise their rights. This study explores how various stakeholders employ zoning in the Numto Nature Park in the oil-rich Russian Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug–Yugra to advance their interests and how they use scientific information to achieve this. Through stakeholder interviews, analysis of electronic media and literature review, we conclude that a participatory and science-based zoning exercise stimulates the necessary deliberation. However, legal ambiguity, deficient law implementation and informal practices limit the zoning's potential to balance stakeholders’ interests. All the stakeholders calculatingly used scientific information to legitimize their own ambitions, activities and claims. Hence, zoning and the underlying information claims should be interpreted as both a resource and a battleground in nature-use conflicts. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

As the most fundamental measure for animal conservation, 8 nature reserves have been established since 1990s. However, due to the rush planning and establishment for protecting the key habitats, most of the reserves lack scientific evaluation for functional zoning. With the growing contradictions between economic development and ecological conservation, it is not easy to efficiently manage nature reserves under current regulations. Optimization and adjustment are urgently needed. Based on national policies, habitat preference of the Yangtze finless porpoise, and major economic development needs such as shipping, this study proposed principles and the following adjustment suggestions for the Yangtze finless porpoise nature reserves: (1) Divide the near-bank waters, river beaches, wetlands, and bifurcated tributaries, which the Yangtze finless porpoise preferred, into the core protected area. (2) Divide the main channel waters and the region between the Yangtze River dike and the core protected area boundary into the general control area. (3) Consider the history issues, refine the management statement in different areas. The above adjustment suggestions make the functional zoning more consistent with the distribution characteristics and habitat preference of the Yangtze finless porpoise, and more efficiently protect their natural population and habitat. Also, it could straighten the legal contradictions existing on the management level of nature reserves, which will make the management more targeted and operable, and provide a practical, feasible model for the healthy development of Yangtze finless porpoise nature reserves. © 2020, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Further surveys in the mid 1990s and early 2000s showed key species were still present and could be conserved. Following a report on these surveys the Ministry of Environment established the Itombwe Reserve in 2006 without consulting local communities who have legitimate customary rights to reside within the area and use the region's natural resources. Although creating the Reserve was within the government's legal authority, its establishment violated the rights of the people there. Here we report over a decade of work by a consortium of international and national human rights and conservation NGOs, the local communities and the protected areas authority (Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature), to remediate this taking of customary rights. Starting in 2008 these partners began a participatory process with all 550 villages within and around the boundary of the Reserve. Using a community resource use mapping approach, developed from best practices, the team helped communities determine the boundary of the Reserve, and then pilot participatory zoning to identify zones for settlements, agriculture, hunting, gathering of non-timber forest products, and conservation. This process secured the customary rights of long-term residents in the Reserve and protected their lands from being taken by non-rights holders. As a result of this work the use rights of communities were largely restored and the communities agreed on 23 June 2016 to formalize the boundaries of the renamed Itombwe Nature Reserve. © 2018 Fauna and Flora International.","Biodiversity; community engagement; conflict resolution; Democratic Republic of Congo; DRC; Itombwe Reserve; protected area establishment","Democratic Republic Congo; Itombwe Mountains; Sud Kivu; biodiversity; biological survey; conflict management; conservation management; government; hunting; legal system; local participation; natural resource; nature reserve; nongovernmental organization; participatory approach; protected area; resource use","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041577932"

Predicting future urban growth and delineating early warning zones can provide scientific guidance for land use planning and ecological protection. However, limited research has targeted fast-urbanizing metropolitan areas, which can be particularly difficult compared with existing approaches conducted in a single city. Another concern is that the adjustable demand of urban land in the future can invalidate simple and rigid zoning schemes. This study proposed a framework of delineating hierarchical early warning zones to represent different probabilities of potential development in vulnerable areas. Specifically, a multiscale urban growth model and biogeography-based optimization (BBO) were integrated for calibrating transition rules and simulating historical urban evolution (2005–2015) in the rapidly growing Yangtze River middle reaches megalopolis (YRMRM) in China. Then, the future urban land demand in 2025 was predicted under different economic development strategies, and multiple urban growth scenarios were simulated by coupling urban demand and spatial planning policies. Finally, simulation results of different scenarios were overlaid in a GIS environment to provide three levels of zones for the early warning of illegal development in the protected areas. Results indicate that BBO performed better in calibrating parameters of the urban growth model than did particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. The prediction of future urban dynamics suggests that urbanization will continue in this region until 2025, and these early warning areas should be given attention for farmland protection and ecological security in the YRMRM. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cellular automata; Early warning zones; Evolutionary algorithms; Illegal development; Planning scenarios; Urban agglomerations","China; agglomeration; algorithm; cellular automaton; early warning system; metropolitan area; numerical model; optimization; probability; regional development; urban development; urban economy; urban growth","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075450618"

The extensiveness of nine municipalities in the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park (PEST—acronym in portuguese) within the limits of the Park, along with the development of cities, displays many interests and land conflicts in the Park. This situation forced, in 2009, governmental parties to establish a new demarcation process, aiming the removal of conflict areas and creation of new categories of protected areas. In this context, this paper aims to report the PEST history, collecting environmental characteristics and land use owned by the environmental protection area of surrounding coastal of the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park, in the northeastern portion of the Baixada Massiambu, the locations of the Pinheira and Guarda do Embaú beaches, in city of Palhoça/SC, Brazil. On this regard, a literature research was performed, referring to the uses of the area under study, as well as the legal and territory definitions; then, field visits were performed from March 2012 to March 2014, and finally, data collected were aggregated using geographic information systems, along with data regarding the ecological and legal characteristics of the area. Results displayed 6501 plots of land on the Pinheira and Guarda do Embaú beaches, and of these, 77% had no environmental restrictions, 13% had partial restrictions, and 10% presented total restrictions. Thus, the PEST delimitation demonstrated great ecological significance for human settlement, especially in some detached areas, which should be kept and preserved. This work makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of the Baixada Massiambu problem, mainly related to land use; protective measures and environmental recovery can be formulated in this region, taking into consideration aspects such as environmental planning and mechanisms of reorganization discussion for this territory. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Demarcations; Environmental cadastre; Environmental protected area of surrounding coastal of Serra do Tabuleiro State Park; Environmental restrictions; Socioeconomic conflicts","Brazil; Portugal; coastal zone; environmental planning; environmental protection; GIS; land use change; national park; protected area; socioeconomic conditions","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042754736"

The Chácara Creek Basin is located in the catchment basin of Vacaria, southern Brazil, where the need for a specific zoning was identified. The Institute of Environmental Sanitation, based on the legislation, mapping, and field research, elaborated the zoning for the Chácara Creek basin. The classes that were considered, refer to its agricultural profile, urban and industrial needs, touristic potential, and protection areas. The major areas correspond to the classes of consolidated agricultural forestry pastoral use zones (54% of the basin area), and water resources, wetland permanent protection zones, grasslands, and native forests in the remaining protection zone (26%).

A typological zoning of the reserve s mountain relief was carried out in all high-Altitude tiers: highlands, middle mountains and lowlands. A transitional zone characterizing large tectonic benches has been identified. For each type of relief, characteristic changes in the course of geomorphological processes associated with the cessation of anthropogenic pressure, mainly in the form of grazing and the establishment of a specially protected area, are determined. It was established that the general tendency to stabilize the slopes prevails, more noticeable in the mountains lower tier and practically absent in the high mountains.

There is, however, minimal spatial protection of marine and coastal ecosystems in the region, potentially reducing the sustainability of the planned development and the likelihood of achieving Sustainable Development Goals. As a precursor to Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) processes in the three countries, and to guide establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), this study aimed to: assess two headline indicators of ecosystem status, namely their potential threat status and current spatial protection levels; and to use Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) to prioritise specific areas for protection to achieve networks of MPAs that are representative of national and regional biodiversity. Two hundred and forty eight ecosystem types in the coastal (n = 134), offshore benthic (n = 86) and pelagic (n = 28) zones of the BCLME were classified, mapped and assessed. Overall, 35% of all ecosystem types in the study domain were threatened, with more threatened coastal (37%) and offshore benthic (37%) ecosystem types compared to pelagic ecosystem types (14%), although the same pattern was not necessarily evident within each country. Nearly two thirds (59%) of the BCLME ecosystem types were not protected in MPAs, and most of those that were well (19%) or moderately protected (14%) were coastal types that are within a single extensive MPA in Namibia. Notwithstanding, there was still a sufficient area of most ecosystem types that was assessed to be in good ecological condition in all three countries and that could be prioritised for representative protection of the region's biodiversity. A portfolio of priority conservation areas was identified from Marxan selection-frequency outputs, providing a spatial vision for protected areas in the BCLME that includes coastal, inshore and offshore areas in all three countries. This first assessment of marine ecosystem threat and protection status for an entire LME demonstrates a rapid science-based approach that can inform integrated ocean management and multiple development goals. The study provides a basis for identifying Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas, potential sites for MPAs or other spatial management in the region, and demonstrates the contribution of SCP and spatial management to MSP. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ecologically or biologically significant marine areas; Ecosystem mapping; Large marine ecosystem; Marine protected areas; Ocean zoning","Angola; Atlantic Ocean; Benguela Current; Namibia; South Africa; Biodiversity; Coastal zones; Conservation; Economics; Environmental protection; Offshore oil well production; Shore protection; Sustainable development; Ecological conditions; Integrated ocean managements; Large marine ecosystem; Marine areas; Marine protected area; Marine Spatial Planning; Socio-economic development; Systematic conservation planning; conservation planning; ecosystem approach; environmental protection; mapping; marine ecosystem; marine environment; pelagic ecosystem; protected area; spatial planning; strategic approach; sustainable development; zoning; Ecosystems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056723713"

In recent years, MPAs have become more than simply tools to improve marine conservation. In fact, their management agencies are actively involved in the sustainable development of nearby communities through the promotion of recreational activities (boating, snorkeling, diving). Even if the recreational uses of the marine environment are generally considered benign, they can potentially be highly detrimental for species and their habitats. As a result, these activities should be controlled through the spatial zoning and the regulation of the MPAs. Thus, the achievement of the conservation goals of the MPAs depends primarily on compliance with the regulations of recreational uses inside their boundaries. The objective of this study was to estimate boating usage and the related level of compliance inside the Capo Gallo and Isola delle Femmine (Italy) MPA. The spatial and temporal trend of boating and the behaviors of boaters were measured through direct observation over a period of 2 summer months. The study highlighted a weakness in the effectiveness of this MPA, linked to a social component and compliance with the regulation. Solutions for effective management plans are outlined thanks to an understanding of the limitations and potential of existing MPA policies.

In countries like Turkey, where the principles of private ownership apply, this right is guaranteed by laws. The right to property may be restricted by law only in the case of public interest. Nevertheless, the right of ownership of immovable property can be transferred to the public authority only with payment. However, in some cases, a person's immovable property may be de facto converted into a public facility without expropriation. This process is called “confiscation without expropriation”. This concept was introduced into the Turkish Legal System in 1956 by the unauthorized conversion of immovable property for a road. Today, especially in planned areas, a different type of confiscation without expropriation is often seen. Zoning plans are known to be public tools that reorganize properties in public interest. However, the uncertainty in the implementation process of these plans negatively affects the owners of parcels reserved for public use in the zoning plan. This situation is defined in terminology as “legal confiscation without expropriation”. In this study, the subject has been discussed in the light of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) decisions and Turkish judicial decisions, and which institutions are responsible for what kind of zoning functions within zoning plans have been investigated. Official (ex officio) applications and voluntary applications have been compared. Conceptual illustrations on the subject have been prepared. According to the results obtained from the study, it has been stated that all public spaces in the zoning plan are not subject to legal confiscation. Due to their location or characteristics, protected areas, unsuitable geological areas and parcels remaining in agricultural areas can be allocated as public spaces in the zoning plan. In such a case, it is not possible to say that there is legal confiscation. In terms of plan classification, there may be legal confiscation in areas if only a 1/1000-scale implementary zoning plan is in practice. As a solution for legal confiscation, land and real estate arrangements should be made ex officio and without delay. In addition to this, alternative models are also needed. Otherwise, public institutions will be subject to severe financial burdens. Some of the proposals include: granting construction right to zone cadastral parcels affecting public facility areas, or granting the right to construct all cadastral parcels in the plan in specified amounts and also developing a zoning right transfer system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Expropriation; Land ownership; Legal confiscation; Without expropriation; Zoning plan","Turkey; decision making; human rights; landownership; policy implementation; zoning policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081278034"

This conflation of flagship and umbrella species is best represented by the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and other large, endangered mammals designated as conservation targets in site selection and planning of reserves. Few empirical studies have tested the effectiveness of flagship species as surrogates for a broader range of sympatric species. Using extensive camera-trap data, we examined the effectiveness of management zones designated to protect flagship (target) species in conserving sympatric species in 4 wildlife reserves (Gutianshan, Changqing, Laohegou, and Wolong). We tested whether the progression from peripheral to core zones was associated with an increasing habitat association for both target and sympatric species. The distribution patterns of the study species across the zones in each reserve indicated a disparity between management zones and the species’ habitat requirements. Management zone was included in the final model for all target species, and most of them had higher occurrence in core zones relative to less-protected zones, but zone was not a predictor for most of the sympatric species. When management zone was associated with the occurrence of sympatric species, threatened species generally had higher detections in core zones, whereas common species had higher detections outside of the core zone. Our results suggested that reserve planning based on flagship species does not adequately protect sympatric species due to their specialized habitat requirements. We recommend re-examining the effectiveness of management zoning and urge a multispecies and reserve-wide monitoring plan to improve protection of China's wildlife. © 2019 Society for Conservation Biology","camera-trapping; cámaras trampa; especie paraguas; especie sustituta; manejo de áreas protegidas; modelo de ocupación; occupancy modeling; protected-area management; spatial zoning; surrogate species; umbrella species; zonación espacial","Animals; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Endangered Species; Sympatry; China; Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Mammalia; conservation management; ecological modeling; endangered species; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; environmental protection; home range; mammal; management practice; nature reserve; protected area; site selection; spatial analysis; surrogate method; sympatry; trapping; wildlife management; animal; China; ecosystem; endangered species; environmental protection; sympatry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070105111"

The high operational cost of monitoring these activities makes it necessary to develop quick and simple evaluation alternatives that allow having a first parameter of trends. Using freeware and basic techniques, I propose a study case to evaluate the increase in vehicle traces for the period 2004-2018 and their potential impact on the vegetation of the Loma de Las Tapias protected area, San Juan, Argentina. M&M: Using pre-existing floristic zoning and two sets of satellite images (2004-2018), vehicle traces were quantified with a grid, and these squares were categorized according to: absence of traces; old traces (2004); new traces (2018) and relapsing traces (2004-2018) on the different floristic units. Results: Currently, from the 223 squares that constitute the grid, only 35 % showed no vehicular traces, while 13.9 % had only old ones, 30 % relapsing traces and the remaining 21.1 % had new vehicular traces. The increase during the evaluated period was uniform in all floristic units. Conclusions: The proposed methodology was simple and fast and allowed detecting the increase of vehicular traces in the area, establishing reference values for subsequent evaluations. The observed increase of traces emphasizes the need to focus on conservation efforts and to incorporate new thematic layers to enrich the management of the protected area. © 2020 Sociedad Argentina de Botanica.","Desert; Environmental impact; Protected areas; Vegetation; Vehicular traces","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089228229"

The regions of Slovakia are represented by the specific nature of natural attractions and exceptional features. Protected areas constitute a national system of protected areas, covering about 23,4% of the Slovak territory. In the overall assumption of the coexistence of nature protection and tourism, nature must be perceived as one of the basic elements of the tourism potential in Slovakia. At the same time, natural beauties are preserved thanks to nature conservation. In this context, it is essential to regard nature conservation as an opportunity for tourism. On the other hand, tourism also contributes to superior nature protection. The fundamental national document, Tourism Development Strategy Of The Slovak Republic Until 2020, devotes attention to the process of zoning, the support of environmentally friendly tourism and it strive for ensuring the development of high-quality, responsible and sustainable tourism, which can provide protection for protected areas. However, its interests must be in compliance with the basic legislative document on nature and landscape protection, which determine the conditions for the protection of such areas in detail.

Qianjiangyuan National Park is one of the ten national park pilot sites in China and is divided into four functional zones, the core protection zone, ecological conservation zone, recreation zone and traditional utilization zone. Each zone is assigned a different level of protection and corresponding management measures. This study examined the spatial overlap of existing functional zones in Qianjiangyuan and suitable habitats for its target conservation species, the endangered black muntjac (Muntiacus crinifrons). We constructed distribution models based on 94 occurrence locations obtained from camera-trapping surveys from 2014-2018 using MaxEnt. Fifteen covariates related to altitude, topography, vegetative characteristics and human disturbance were used in the MaxEnt models to predict suitable habitats for the black muntjac. The results showed that the black muntjac tended to inhabit areas with intact forest and low road density. We identified 42.5 km                             2                              of suitable habitat, which accounted for 16.9% of the land in Qianjiangyuan National Park. Of this suitable habitat, 69.3% and 30.4% were located in the core protection zone and ecological conservation zone, respectively, which indicated that the existing zone designations can protect black muntjac habitat appropriately. These results also indicated that the black muntjac may serve as an indicator species of the subtropical primary forests where it lives. Promoting habitat integrity for the black muntjac by restoring habitat, constructing corridors and managing across provinces will be key to strengthening the protection of the black muntjac in the region.                          © 2019, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In the investigated area there are territories with high potential for conservation, which are characterized by the presence of species from the Red Data Book of Ukraine and International Red Lists, plant communities from the Green Data Book of Ukraine and biotopes of global significance. The proposed ten sites should receive protected status, which will bring the protected area up to the necessary minimum to preserve the rare ecosystems of the park from tourism and economic pressure, which have intensified in recent years. For the period of research in 2014–2018, 14 types of sozophytes were identified and confirmed, two of them are the highly localised species endemic to Dzharylhach Island: Molinia euxina Pobed. and Poacynum russanovii (Pobed.)

To implement habitat management and conservation measures in protected areas, it is important to identify the factors related to roadkill at the landscape scale. The purpose of this study was to clarify the landscape factors involved in roadkill of the endangered Ryukyu long-furred (Diplothrix legata) rat in Yambaru, the northern Okinawa-jima Island, Japan. We analyzed the relationship between roadkill sites and landscape factors (evergreen broad-leaved forest area, artificial pine forest area, average vegetation height, and minimum radius of road curve) using a generalized linear model, incorporating spatial autocorrelation using Moran’s eigenvector maps along a 13.9 km route using census data from May 2011 to April 2017. In addition, we clarified the relationship between the number of roadkills and national park zoning. Roadkill incidence was found to be positively correlated with average vegetation height and the percentage of pine forest area. The number of roadkill incidents was also higher in zones with higher levels of protection compared to areas with lower or no protection.

In Brazil, national-level spatial planning processes are still incipient. This article offers a systematic review through a comparative meta-analysis of the literature on MPAs and spatial planning based on the following questions: (I) What topics are investigated in spatial planning in MPAs worldwide? and (II) What are the advances and trends of these topics in Brazilian MPAs? Specific goals of this study are (I) to identify studies on Brazil; and (II) to compare and contrast these with studies performed elsewhere. The PRISMA report was used to select literature, with a focus on three spatial contexts (I) outside Brazil, analyzing studies from other countries; (II) in Brazil; and (III) a case study in Brazil that focuses on a sustainable-use area in northeastern Pará. Studies outside Brazil showed three major groups of themes: (I) planning and tools; (II) stakeholders; and (III) the ecology of non-human species. For the Brazilian context, studies were grouped into five major themes: (I) small-scale fishing practices and conflicts; (II) participation in protected areas; (III) technical aspects of the planning process, (IV) zoning; and (V) mapping. The local case study investigates socio-cultural sustainability and tourism. All identified studies relate to use, but have a greater focus on conservation and, especially abroad, on species and ecosystems. There are few reviews or comparative studies that could help to draw parallels between the different spatial planning settings. We conclude that synthesis work on spatial management strategies worldwide is needed, including the elaboration of frameworks to develop measures to address the widespread lack of data and spatial planning expertise. Collaborative networks of researchers and practitioners are needed for this. The novelty in our study is that it examines MPAs and spatial planning research at three spatial contexts with innovative methodologies to represent the current state of the spatial planning discourse in coastal and marine conservation. © Copyright © 2020 Borges, Eyzaguirre, Barboza and Glaser.","fisheries; marine spatial planning (MSP); spatial management; stakeholders; systematic review","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091099361"

For coastal delphinids, outlining their habitat configuration becomes a real challenge when faced with large distribution ranges that straddle international borders, leaving broad information gaps in uninvestigated areas. This study projected likely habitats of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis, in the Beibu Gulf (Gulf of Tonkin) based on occurrence data and remotely sensed oceanographic characteristics. Net primary productivity was derived to measure the ecosystem service of humpback dolphin habitats. Bathymetry and chlorophyll-a concentration are major variables contributing to humpback dolphin habitat configuration, which is characterized by shallow water depth and high primary productivity. Three major, likely habitats were identified in the northern Beibu Gulf from western Leizhou Peninsula to the China–Vietnam border, western Gulf of Tonkin from the Red River estuary to the central coast of Vietnam, and south-western Hainan Island. Less than 9% of likely habitats are currently protected by marine protected areas. Affinity to high primary productivity and shallow depths implies that prey abundance and foraging efficiency influence habitat selection by Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. Anthropogenic activities potentially altering oceanographic characteristics may impact regional marine ecosystem functions, and hence habitat configuration. Habitat protection actions for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins include implementing coordinated and systematic surveys in major habitats, associating core habitat protection with protected area networks and maritime function zoning, ensuring ecosystem function integrity within major habitats, and reducing both explicit lethal impacts and implicit anthropogenic impacts from activities that change oceanographic features. The habitat protection plan should not only consider marine habitats, but also adjacent coastal landscapes and river catchments. This requires coordination, collaboration and information sharing between scientific research teams, government policy representatives, non-governmental organizations, local communities and other interested stakeholders. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","ecosystem services; habitat configuration; habitat protection actions; Maxent modelling; net primary productivity; oceanographic characteristics; Sousa chinensis","China; Guangdong; Gulf of Tonkin; Hainan; Leizhou Peninsula; Pacific Ocean; Red River [United States]; South China Sea; United States; Viet Nam; Delphinidae; Sousa chinensis; action plan; bathymetry; catchment; chlorophyll a; coastal zone management; dolphin; ecosystem service; endangered species; environmental planning; environmental protection; habitat management; habitat structure; human activity; marine environment; net primary production; nongovernmental organization; obligate behavior; policy making; protected area; remote sensing; shallow water; software; stakeholder","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060804110"

Fishers' perceptions about the MPA and the impact it had on the fishing activity over time were identified just before the full implementation of the zoning and regulations of the management plan and 10 years later. This study aimed to investigate fishers' knowledge, acceptance and perceptions about the MPA changed with time, if support for the MPA was linked to the impact of the MPA on the fishing activity, and if fishers' perceptions about the impact of the MPA on the fishing activity match with local landings trends. Results show that although knowledge about the marine park significantly improved over time, fishers' acceptance did not. A decrease on fishers' support was not substantial but occurred. Issues such as the disagreement with regulations reinforced concerns raised during the implementation of the marine park, particularly in relation to the top-down decision-making, which commonly confers minor participation, recognition and legitimacy to fishers. Apparently, fisheries benefits were still not perceived by local fishers, though they are central for fishers' support. Further, the perceived negative impacts of the park seemed to be more related to social aspects and individual interests than to impacts on catches. Addressing adequate management, enforcement and participation of local fishers is still possible and are advocated here as to contribute to the expected socioecological outcomes and respective support, leading to the future successful performance of the Arrábida Marine Park. Assessing fishers’ perceptions towards an MPA over time is central and should be included on periodical socioecological monitoring and inform an effective adaptive management. © 2020 Shanghai Ocean University","Arrabida Marine Park (AMP); Attitudes; Changes over time; Decision-making; Fishers' support; Local fisheries; Marine protected area; Perceptions","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080090187"

It is comprised of unique land-use systems and agricultural landscapes formed by long-term co-evolution and dynamic adaptation of rural communities and their environment. IAHS sites are rich in biodiversity and support of local socio-economic and cultural development. They also play a positive role in coordinating community livelihoods and ecological protection through their soil and water management strategies, knowledge systems, and cultural connotations. Therefore, it is of great significance to assess the value of IAHS for adaptive IAHS management per se, as well as optimizing the protected area system and its zoning-based management according to human-environment interactions. Our study first reviewed the value systems of related concepts, focusing on natural resource assets, ecosystem functions and services, and various types of natural and cultural heritage to generalize the value typology and assessment methods for heritage systems and their key elements. We then examined the uniqueness of IAHS based on our understanding of the general agricultural heritage systems (AHS) and the more specific Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) to ensure that characteristics such as complexity, vitality, and strategy were fully reflected in the value system. IAHS is comprised of both material and non-material parts. Its' complexity indicates the assimilation of values from natural and cultural heritage, as well as cultural landscapes. Vitality implies the system's dynamics based on its historical and current value as an adaptive system. Strategy defines the positive externality of IAHS towards people beyond its local area, determining its contribution to regional and global sustainable development strategies. Afterwards, the value typology of IAHS was proposed. The value system was firstly divided into existence and potential values to reflect the impact of IAHS on the current and future generation. The existence value was further separated into carrier and service values. The carrier value is the intrinsic value based on the physical formation of agricultural land as an asset stock during its historical period. The service value is the measure of flow from the stock. It is composed of nine values, namely the product value, ecological value, sci-tech value, social value, aesthetic value, cultural value, historical value, spiritual value, and brand value, and is further divided to 25 value elements at the lowest level. We also proposed possible evaluation methods and statistical approaches targeting at potential indicators of the existence value to obtain the monetary value of certain IAHS to better implement this multi-layered value system in policy making and conservation management. Key methods were selected from practices that evaluated ecosystem services, farmland, and natural resources, including the direct marketing method, substitutable marketing method, and simulated market method. Non-material value elements, which usually were only valued quantitatively, were discussed to determine the difficulty and possibility of quantitative accounting. As a result, the value typology can help managers identify IAHS conservation focal points according to the value connotation. The existence value must be well preserved. The potential value should be further studied. The conservation of the carrier value is mainly dependent on local farmland protection. Some service values benefiting large areas are better protected via regional cooperation. As a result, this research revealed the values embedded in human-environment interactions in the IAHS and interpreted their importance in maintaining a harmony between human and environment; thus providing a theoretical basis for spatial integration and management optimization of protected areas, as well as coordinative decision-making for regional conservation and development. It also provided a whole set of value systems and evaluation methods for the monetary value of IAHS; synthesized from quantitative or qualitative methods used in ecosystem services, natural resources assets, natural and cultural heritages, and brands. © 2020, Science Press.

This expansion has been accompanied by claims that only No-take MPAs (NTMPAs) can effectively ensure biodiversity conservation, and the international marine conservation community has become increasingly active and influential in promoting them. However, NTMPAs clearly have consequences for resource users whose livelihoods are impacted by restricted access to natural resources. Since these consequences can trigger social conflicts that impeded progress towards conservation goals, there have been concerted efforts to find collaborative and inclusive approaches to MPA planning and management. This paper assesses stakeholder engagement in decision-making processes related to marine conservation planning and management in the Galapagos Marine Reserve, and examines how these have been influenced by shifting narratives of biodiversity conservation in the lead up to, and the execution of, the 2016 rezoning process. A dramatic shift in the rezoning process, a top-down declaration of a no-take MPA, fostered social conflicts that have delayed the full-implementation of the new zoning plan even three years after its official declaration. Through a mixed-methods approach we contrast perceptions, expectations and experiences of key actors in three stakeholder groups: the small-scale fisheries sector, the scientific research community, and the conservation management sector. This study illustrates challenges associated with rushed conservation initiatives, promoted and supported by large external conservation NGOs, and it demonstrates how a “back to the barriers” approach to conservation can undermine acceptance of conservation practices and jeopardize the success of MPAs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Exclusionary decision-making; Governance; Marine protected areas; No-take zones; Stakeholder engagement; The Galapagos Islands","Ecuador; Ecuador; Galapagos Islands; Galapagos Marine Reserve; Biodiversity; Conservation; Environmental protection; Fisheries; Biodiversity conservation; Conservation management; Decision making process; Galapagos Islands; Galapagos Marine Reserve; Governance; Marine protected area; Stakeholder engagement; biodiversity; conservation management; conservation planning; decision making; governance approach; marine environment; protected area; stakeholder; Decision making","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076578460"

Taking the Beijing Great Wall National Park System Pilot Area as an example, this paper selects the indicators from the three aspects of ""ecological background"", ""resource characteristics"" and ""human interference"" to construct an index system for natural resources protection zoning. Using subcompartment as a zoning unit, the national park is divided into seven natural resource protection areas at first according to the ecological background characteristics, which are used as the basic units for resource survey and management of national parks. Then the national park are further subdivided into 17 kinds of natural resource protection areas according to the specific resource problems and protection demands, forming a two-level natural resource protection zoning scheme. Furthermore, corresponding protection measures are proposed based on the protection objectives of each protected area. The zoning scheme avoids the difficulty of coordination caused by the overlapping or misplaced space layout of various types of land in the national park. Moreover, it is also conducive to the implementation of natural resource protection zoning scheme and the effective protection of natural resources in the national park. © 2019 Science Press.

This assumption increases the risk of erroneous conclusions in assessing marine zoning, and consequently counter-productive management actions. Accordingly, it is important to understand how fishers respond to a combination of the implementation of no-take zones, and various climatic and human drivers of change. Those adaptive responses could influence the interpretation of assessment of no-take zone effectiveness, yet few studies have examined these aspects. Indeed, such analysis is often unfeasible in developing countries, due to the dominance of data-poor fisheries, which precludes full examination of the social-ecological outcomes of MPAs. In the Galapagos Marine Reserve (Ecuador), however, the availability of long-term spatially explicit fishery monitoring data (1997–2011) for the spiny lobster fishery allows such an analysis. Accordingly, we evaluated how the spatiotemporal allocation of fishing effort in this multiple-use MPA was affected by the interaction of diverse climatic and human drivers, before and after implementation of no-take zones. Geographic information system modelling techniques were used in combination with boosted regression models to identify how these drivers influenced fishers’ behavior. Our results show that the boom-and-bust exploitation of the sea cucumber fishery and the global financial crisis 2007–09, rather than no-take zone implementation, were the most important drivers affecting the distribution of fishing effort across the archipelago. Both drivers triggered substantial macro-scale changes in fishing effort dynamics, which in turn altered the micro-scale dynamics of fishing patterns. Fishers’ adaptive responses were identified, and their management implications analyzed. This leads to recommendations for more effective marine and fishery management in the Galapagos, based on improved assessment of the effectiveness of no-take zones. © 2020 Castrejón, Charles.

Some major problems facing these tropical fisheries include overcapacity, depleted fish stocks, conflicts between commercial and traditional fleets, dramatic changes in species composition, and the stress on marine ecosystems due to human activities. Popular management strategies focus on input controls (e.g., mesh size), gear selectivity, marine protected areas, zoning systems, and licensed moratoriums. Although a legal framework exists to regulate fisheries, the suboptimal management performance may be attributed to the maritime enforcement agency's generalist role, limited knowledge on the distribution patterns of fish assemblages, inconsistencies between federal and state laws on fisheries, and a top-down management approach. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem; Fishery management; Input controls; South-East-Asia; Straits Malacca; Trawl fisheries","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088049846"

Functional zoning, the most relevant process in protected area planning and management, is an integral part of the optimization of the system. Natural parks, an important part of these protected areas, also have many problems with functional zoning; for example, the inadequate coordination between the development of both the ecology and economy and the lack of studies for a comprehensive planning have not led to a sustainable development of these protected areas. Therefore, to solve these zoning issues, this study proposes a comprehensive functional zoning method for natural parks, applying it to the Huangshan Scenic Area as an example. The method is based on the assessment of irreplaceability, ecological vulnerability, condition of landscape resources, and ecological suitability. From a functional perspective, natural parks can be first divided into protected ecological, protected landscape, and developmental zones. Both the protected ecological and landscape zones can be further subdivided into core and important zones. In addition, the developmental zone can be further subdivided into recreational, agricultural, and living zones. © 2019 Science Press.

With the purpose of providing a baseline assessment of reef fish to subsidize the management of Pedra da Risca do Meio Marine State Park (whose acronym in Portuguese is PEMPRM), we describe the composition and assemblages structure of the fishes in this MPA. To inventory the species, we conducted 112 SCUBA dives with the intensive search method at eight sites inside the PEMPRM during six years of sampling. In parallel, to assess the structure of the assemblages, we conducted 63 stationary visual censuses distributed among three of these sites during one year of sampling. In total, 131 taxa belonging to 54 families were identified representing approximately half of the regional diversity. Thirteen of these species (10%) are included in categories with some level of threat IUCN or Brazilian red list categories and six are considered endemic to the Brazilian Biogeographic Province. The assemblages of the three studied sites varied in species richness, number of endangered species, and trophic structure. These results were corroborated by multivariate analyses (PERMANOVA) that indicated significant differences among the assemblages of the three sites.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess the visitation at Caparaó National Park, map the main trails open to the public, and determine their degree of degradation. To define the most relevant trails for this study, the following criteria were used: visitation demand, impact intensity, and zoning. The elevation profile and other physical attributes of the selected trails were obtained by GPS. Erosion was established as the predominant impact, and the length of eroded stretches on each trail was evaluated. The trail to Pico da Bandeira through Casa Queimada has a greater declivity, and, although it sees fewer visitors than the trail to Pico da Bandeira through Tronqueira, it shows a higher erosion rate. This result indicates that, in certain cases, the declivity can contribute more significantly to the increase in erosion than the number of visitors. © 2019 Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.","Erosion; Pico da Bandeira; Protected areas; Public use","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073223044"

Moscow is one of the most fast-growing European cities, therefore, this problem has a great relevance there. Two case study areas, Severny and Altufjevsky reserves, covering about 94 and 82 hectares, are located in the north of Moscow. PA Regulations, published in 2020 and approved by Government of Moscow, are the main data sources, particularly for land-use planning, protection regimes and special structures. Besides, the results of landscape structure investigations, open-access data by Information System Ensuring Spatial Planning (ISOGD), Moscow Government open-access data hub were used. According to Regulations, natural and semi-natural zones constitute only 37% и 16% of the total area. Spatial differences between present environment state and zoning established by regional laws were analyzed by GIS-overlay and rating scales. Moreover, PA socio-economic potential was investigated, using rating scales of 7 groups of functions. Overlay difference between environmental and socio-economic potentials (EP1-SEP parameter) has become the tool to detect spaces providing ecosystem protection functions, but exposed to strong human impact. Although some areas are used mostly for social and economic purposes, semi-natural zones are under quite strict protection regimes. Area-weighted EP1-SEP parameter of PA are estimated to 2.9 and 2.4 respectively (from a possible range from −20 to 20) and hence zoning is correlated with ecosystem functions in general, except large-scale inconsistencies. This algorithm can be used to resolve a dilemma between protection and exploitation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","GIS; Integral assessment; Protected areas; Spatial analysis; Spatial planning; Urban ecology; Urban reserves","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105622939"

Through the analysis of mapping materials and regulations, using the QGIS software the map of the NRF objects distribution in Kyiv has been constructed. The area of these sites is also calculated and the degree of preservation in each administrative district of the city is determined. Each year, the Kyiv City Council declaratively extends the NRF area, but most of urban protected areas (UPA) do not accomplish their tasks and gradually lose the natural value previously created to preserve them. Due to the lack of funding and mismanagement, new ecological conflicts are emerging within these institutions and, as a result, degrading natural ecosystems. For example, the only urban National Natural Park (NNP) in Ukraine “Holosiyivskyi” since its inception in 1994 still has no official boundaries. Holosiyivskyi forest, the central part of the NNP, surrounded by residential buildings and highways from all sides, has the smallest area of reserved zone among the other Park massifs. Another illustrative example is the Lysa Hora Regional Landscape Park (RLP), where residential development comes close to its area. The RLP protected regime is disrupted along its existence and is only a declaration. Therefore, erosion processes are activated, red-book species die, nature use conflicts are widespread, ecosystem values are degraded. The study justifies the inefficiency of the NRF area further formal expansion in the Kyiv city. UPA activities largely do not meet the functions and criteria set by law. To improve the management of NRF institutions, it is proposed to change their functional zoning procedure and to transfer zoning on a landscape basis. In order to reduce the risk of illegal development near the UPA boundaries, it is necessary to develop land management projects for NRF institutions, to define their boundaries and to strengthen control over the implementation of Ukrainian environmental legislation. Creating buffer zones around the UPA protecting them from the adverse effects of urban infrastructure can prevent the chaotic development and further degradation of the ecosystems. The scientific novelty of the study is in identifying the causes of the digression of Kyiv’s protected areas and substantiating measures to overcome them. The spatial distribution of NRF institutions was determined and their structural and functional organization analyzed in order to achieve the purpose of the study. © 2020, National Academy of Sciences.

Obtaining information on spatio-temporal occurrence patterns of cetaceans can be especially challenging. This study used platforms of opportunity (i.e., fishing monitoring vessels) from May 2004 to May 2012 as a cost-effective way to address this knowledge gap in the Wakatobi National Park (WNP) at the heart of Coral Triangle, an important area for cetaceans in Indonesia. A database was created of cetacean sightings per surveyed days at sea, allowing for an analysis of species diversity and habitat use around the islands. Of the 11 cetacean species identified, spinner and bottlenose dolphins were sighted most often, followed by melon-headed and sperm whales. Spinner dolphin showed a wide distribution in the area, whilst bottlenose dolphin and melon-headed whale occupied the waters between the main islands and south atolls. Sperm whales occurred mostly in waters north of the main islands and as melon-headed whales, mostly in deep waters. Most cetacean sightings occurred in the zones designated for human use, indicating where potential conflicts might occur. No sightings were found in the Park core zone, suggesting a mismatch between WNP design and the cetacean ecological needs. Based on a sub-sample of the dedicated fishing monitoring sightings a sighting frequency was derived. Small and large cetaceans were reported mostly during inter-monsoonal seasons, possibly related to increased prey availability due to seasonal upwelling and increased survey activity. Inter-annual occurrence of cetaceans was variable, with no large cetaceans being sighted in 2010–2012, likely due to reduced survey efforts. In areas with limited resources for designated surveys, the use of platforms of opportunity can be a cost-effective tool to provide valuable data on cetacean occurrence. While data collection protocols in the WNP can be improved further, the results presented here already help identify potentially important areas as well as highlight where to direct designated research efforts. We advise to protect currently unprotected cetacean important habitats, and strictly regulate human activities in the current use zones for future WNP rezoning processes. © Copyright © 2020 Sahri, Mustika, Purwanto, Murk and Scheidat.","cetacean; Coral Triangle; marine park management; platforms of opportunity; spatio-temporal occurrence","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095425304"

Visual assessments were conducted around the seven main islands by means of 36 ROV transects. The video material was divided into 3 parts belonging to 3 Archipelago sectors (Western, Central and Eastern) and into 3 depth ranges (20-50, 51-120, 121-190). Thirty taxa of teleosts (29 species and 1 genus) belonging to 16 families were recorded. The assemblages were numerically dominated by some schooling fishes, such as Anthias anthias, Callanthias ruber and Chromis chromis that exhibited a depth-related partitioning of space, and three non-gregarious species, namely Serranus cabrilla, Coris julis and Lappanella fasciata. In terms of species composition, the assemblages observed in the sectors of the Archipelago largely overlapped. No significant sector-related differences were detected in fish species richness, diversity and total density. Species composition and the investigated assemblage parameters were significantly affected by depth. The pattern of variation in species richness among depth ranges differed from one archipelago sector to another. No significant interaction between the depth range and sector factors was observed in terms of species diversity and total density. Diversity values at 20-50 and 121-190 m depth were similar and significantly higher than at 51-120 m depth. Fish total density showed a clear downward trend with increasing depth, although significant differences were detected between the 20-50 and 51-120 depth layers and the deepest one. Overall, the demersal fish assemblage of the Aeolian Archipelago was poorly diversified and depleted, most likely due to overfishing.

The environmental impacts of wind turbines have emerged as a dominant consideration in the planning process in order to increase public acceptance, protect the surrounding environment and to conserve pristine ecosystems. Hence, ensuring holistic planning and community participation are key factors if wind-generated electricity is to be expanded. Existing macro-planning methods lack quantifiable models for assessing wind turbines’ full environmental implications. The current study uses a holistic and quantitative methodology to identify suitable sites for wind turbines in the north of Israel using available GIS software. By evaluating a broad range of local environmental and spatial conditions, the research improves on existing GIS modeling. The spatial criteria that affect zoning optimization are then applied using a Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The results indicate that 0.5% of possible sites in the study area are suitable for wind turbine development according to the strictest environmental constraints. Anthropocentric environmental impacts from turbines were found to be significant whenever sites were located less than 750 m from settlements. Ecological impacts, however, were not found to be correlated with the distance from natural protected areas.

This was emphasized by The Nature Conservancy’s (TNC) Coral Reef Report Card which highlighted not only the lack of data collection in Antigua and Barbuda and other Caribbean nations, but also illustrated how spatially dispersed available datasets are.

The Atlantic Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) protocol has been identified as a means to address planning and management for marine areas. Three AGRRA surveys have been conducted in the years following the TNC 2016 report, in previously established managed areas: North East Marine Management Area (NEMMA) in 2017 and Nelson Dockyard National Park (NDNP) in 2019 as well as areas outlined for future management (Redonda in 2018). Our surveys were conducted to provide updated datasets to inform management for the aforementioned areas. While the results of these surveys mirror the underlying poor coral reef-health conditions, which have been shown to exist within the Caribbean region, they also highlight intra-site variation that exists within each survey location. This knowledge can be crucial in guiding management decisions in these marine areas, through zoning and other management prescriptions. Additionally, the marine surveys conducted around Redonda established useful marine baselines to aid in monitoring the island’s recovery following removal of terrestrial invasive species. This article provides an overview of data collected using the AGRRA methodology in marine zones across Antigua and Barbuda which have current or future management prescriptions and provides recommendations to demonstrate the data’s future utilization for marine conservation and management.

Optimizing the design of marine protected area (MPA) networks for the conservation of migratory marine species and their habitats involves a suite of important considerations, such as appropriate scale requirements and the distribution of anthropogenic impacts. Often, a fundamental component of the conservation planning process is delineating areas of high use or high biodiversity within a region of interest. 2. However, basing conservation strategies off merely the number of individuals in an ecosystem is outdated and potentially subject to arbitrary thresholds. To be effective at protecting marine megafauna, MPAs would ideally encompass habitats used by focal species. Through satellite-tracking studies, evidence of whether species actually use protected areas is emerging. 3. Here, we present a multispecies perspective on habitat selection within existing MPAs throughout the Floridian ecoregion, which encompasses coastal Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. Using an 11-year satellite-tracking dataset on 235 marine turtles, we used integrated step selection analysis to quantify the effects of sea turtle behavioural state (identified by a switching state-space model), protected area status, chlorophyll and bathymetry on habitat selection. 4. Our results show that sea turtles do select for existing protected areas, specifically multi-use zones, while controlling for the effects of depth and primary productivity. However, our analysis revealed that turtles showed no selection for the no-take zones within MPAs, during either transiting or foraging. 5. These findings contribute to the existing literature base of MPA use for highly mobile, imperilled species and could inform management of existing MPAs or changes to zoning, specifically multi-use to no-take. Our use of a robust spatial modelling framework to evaluate habitat selection relative to MPAs could be incorporated into conservation planning to build MPA networks designed to accommodate migratory species. © 2021 The Authors.

Concretely, the Mediterranean Sea is facing a huge demand of resources and marine activities while hosting abundant and unique biodiversity. It is considered an important elasmobranch hotspot where seventy-two elasmobranch species are present in the basin. Despite the recognised importance of elasmobranchs as umbrella species, to date only a small number of marine protected areas have been designated towards their protection. The paucity of spatially-explicit abundance data on elasmobranchs often precludes the designation of these areas to protect these marine predators. Here, we aimed to identify marine areas to protect elasmobranch species by means of a systematic spatial planning approach. We first estimated the spatial distribution of five elasmobranch species (three sharks and two rays) in the western Mediterranean Sea and then applied Marxan decision support tools to find priority marine conservation areas. We found that the five elasmobranchs are distributed in coastal and slope areas of the southern waters of the study area while in the northern region they are abundant in the continental slope and towards offshore waters. Conservation priority areas were identified in the southern part of the western Mediterranean. Adding more complex cost layers and zoning to the analysis did not alter conservation priority areas, confirming such areas are highly consistent and highly important for elasmobranch protection. The marine conservation priority areas identified here can contribute to designate a proactive area-based protection strategy towards elasmobranch conservation, related species and the habitats that they depend in the western Mediterranean Sea. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","","Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Mediterranean Sea; Sharks; Mediterranean Region; Chondrichthyes; Elasmobranchii; Biodiversity; Decision support systems; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Offshore oil well production; Conservation priorities; Decision support tools; Marine conservations; Marine protected area; Mediterranean ecosystem; Socio-ecological systems; Western Mediterranean; Western Mediterranean Sea; abundance; coastal zone management; environmental policy; environmental protection; marine park; sustainability; sustainable development; article; decision support system; habitat; Mediterranean Sea; nonhuman; predator; shark; animal; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental protection; Conservation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087411363"

Therefore, it is important to understand the effects of these constructions on the environment and local communities. This work presents a land use and land cover change temporal analysis considering a 33-year period (1985-2018) in the direct influence zone of the Braço Norte Hydropower Complex, Brazilian Amazonia, using the Collection 4.1 level 3 of the freely available MapBiomas dataset. Additionally, we have assessed the Brazilian Amazon large-scale deforestation process acting as a land use and land cover change driver in the study area. Our findings show that the most impacted land cover was forest formation (from 414 km2 to 287 km2, a reduction of 69%), which primarily shifted into pasturelands (increase of 664%, from 40 km2 to 299 km2). The construction of the hydropower complex also triggered indirect impacts such as the presence of urban areas in 2018 and the consequent increased local demand for crops. Together with the ongoing large-scale Amazonian deforestation process, the construction of the complex has intensified changes in the study area as 56.42% of the pixels were changed between 1985 and 2018. This indicates the importance of accurate economic and environmental impact studies for assessing social and environmental consequences of future construction in this unique region. Our results reveal the need for adopting special policies to minimize the impact of these constructions, for example, the creation of Protected Areas and the definition of locally-adjusted parameters for the ecological-economic zoning considering environmental and social circumstances derived from the local actors that depend on the natural environment to subsist such as indigenous peoples, riverine population, and artisanal fishermen. © 2020 by the authors.","Environmental impact; Hydroelectric energy; LULCC drivers; MapBiomas; Temporal analysis","Brazil; Conservation; Construction; Coverings; Deforestation; Hydroelectric Power; Land Use; Processes; Brazil; Conservation; Deforestation; Environmental impact; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Land use; Brazilian Amazonia; Ecological economics; Environmental impact study; Hydropower complexes; Indigenous people; Land use and land cover change; Natural environments; Social and environmental; environmental impact; hydroelectric power; land cover; land use change; protected area; spatiotemporal analysis; Economic and social effects","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091301765"

In Brazil, Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) policies have been implemented to marine management, however, in an independent way. This article presents the patchwork of marine policies in the State of São Paulo (Southeast of Brazil) and analyses their implementation process, symmetry and the integration between them. The policies analysed were the State Plan for Coastal Zone Management and the Marine Protected Areas of São Paulo Coast. Four main procedures were conducted: 1) a historical survey of marine policies legal establishment; 2) the analysis of criteria used to determine the marine zonings, 3) the production of maps to identify policies and marine zonings overlaps and; 4) the analysis of the implementation stage of policies by comparing the procedures accomplished by the policies analysed with the procedures proposed by the marine planning, management and conservation (MPMC) frameworks. It was observed that the policies analysed have not fully implemented the management procedures yet, such as the plans of management and monitoring programs, accomplishing only the basic procedures recommended by the MPMC frameworks. Marine zonings’ criteria were mainly derived from political-economic interests at the expense of ecological features. Asymmetry and little integration between policies were verified. It resulted in the MPAs being ruled in part by the ICZM policy. A wider Ecosystem-based Marine Spatial Planning strategy (EBM-MSP), supported by a committee of integration, could sew this “blue patchwork” considering the multiple uses in the territory and fostering policies full implementation. To achieve coherence on this decision-making process, MPMC policies’ instruments should be founded on ecosystem-based management and on governance mechanisms with representatives’ parity. Future studies should advance in investigating marine policies’ symmetry and integration, stakeholders’ dynamics and zoning criteria towards the sustainability of ecosystems services. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem-based management; Integrated coastal zone management; Marine protected areas; Marine spatial planning; Sustainable development","Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Coastal engineering; Coastal zones; Conservation; Decision making; Ecosystems; Integration; Regional planning; Surveys; Sustainable development; Zoning; Coastal zone management; Decision making process; Ecosystem-based management; Implementation process; Integrated coastal zone management; Management and conservations; Marine protected area; Marine Spatial Planning; coastal zone management; conservation management; ecosystem management; environmental legislation; integrated approach; legal system; marine environment; marine policy; policy implementation; protected area; spatial planning; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; Environmental protection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058063506"

Protected areas should be an effective way to protect cultural landscapes and support the way of life and the economy of the local population. However, nature conservation policymaking processes and management guidelines frequently do not take culturalness into account. Through a new quantitative approach, this paper analyzes the regulatory framework of two protected areas under different management categories, located in an ancient cultural landscape of the Madrid Region (Central Spain), to identify the similarities in their conservation commitments and the effectiveness of their zoning schemes. The results show some arbitrariness in the design and management of these parks, highlighting the importance of prohibited measures in their zoning schemes that encourage uses and activities more related to naturalness than to culturalness. The recognition of protected areas as cultural landscapes and their management considering both naturalness and culturalness issues are important methods of better achieving sustainable management objectives from a social-ecological approach. This methodological approach has proven useful to unravel various legislative content, and its application on a larger scale could reveal important information for the sound management of protected areas (PAs) in cultural landscapes. © 2019 by the authors.","Biocultural heritage; Comparative law; Culturalness; Naturalness; Protected area regulations; Regulation schemes; Social-ecological systems; Traditional ecological knowledge; Zoning coherence; Zoning consistency","Madrid [Spain]; Spain; conservation management; conservation status; cultural landscape; design method; knowledge; naturalness; nature conservation; park management; policy making; protected area; regulatory framework; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066991448"

The study revealed the shortcomings of the UPA functional zoning procedure without applying a landscape approach, regardless of its importance for preventing nature management conflicts. According to the research goals, it is necessary to study the UPA landscape structure and transfer the functional zoning procedure to the landscape basis. Holosiyivskyi Forest, as one of the five massifs in Holosiyivskyi NNP, was chosen for the analysis. A landscape map was created and a landscape-functional zoning scheme of the Holosiyivskyi Forest territory was updated using field research findings, available digital maps and GIS tools. Moreover, the relief morphometric parameters were reflected in the digital model and a hypsometric map of Holosiyivskyi Forest was created on its basis. By providing maximum correspondence of the nature management structure in each functional zone with the existing landscape structure of the territory, traditional zoning turns into a landscape functional one. The study assessed the adverse impact of the urban environment on Holosiyivskyi Forest’s natural landscapes. The research demonstrates the imperfection of Ukrainian nature conservation legislation, the absence of the Holosiyivskyi NNP land management project and the need to define the Park’s true boundaries around its territory.

It is a new trend that takes mathematical models as a tool to study the reserve design. Traditional mathematical models, such as the set covering species problem (SCSP) and the maximal covering species problem (MCSP), only consider to plan and design the reserve at the lowest cost. They do not consider spatial characteristics of the reserve, leading to over fragmentation of the selected areas for nature reserve. In addition, these methods only consider the price of land which cannot fully reflect the ecological value of the protected areas. This study uses the ecological value as indicators and associated with the spatial characteristics of continuity and compactness to construct an effective and reasonable model for nature reserve design. The proposed model was aimed to establish the nature reserve and provided a scientific basis for nature reserve establishment. 【Method】Taking Daiyun Mountain national nature reserve of Fujian Province as an example, we divided the reserve into 567 regular blocks. The area of each block was 2 km×2 km and each had several sub-compartments. Firstly, according to the scoring standards for ecological values and the weighting algorithm, the ecological value of sub-compartments and its associated blocks was calculated successively. Secondly, based on the special spatial characteristics and ecological values, the space-ecology set covering problem (SSCP) based on the tail length algorithm was constructed, and the effects of various combinations between the compactness with different weights and the percentage of protected species on overall performance of protected areas were discussed. Finally, the traditional SCSP model, the system protection planning tool Marxan model and the Zoning model were used as the control group to verify the validity of the SSCP model. 【Results】 From the perspective of spatial distribution, the design results of the protected area solved by SCSP model, Marxan model and Zonation model were as follows: the distribution of the blocks was discrete and the degree of fragmentation was high. In contrast, the design of the SSCP model showed better continuity and compactness than previous methods. The number of selected blocks of the SSCP model was positively correlated with the proportion of species protection and the weight of compactness, indicating an increase of the proportion of species protection or an increase of the weight of density, would come up with an increase of the number of selected blocks. 【Conclusion】The mathematical programming model for new type of protected area, i.e. the SSCP model, was studied. The rationality of the algorithm was verified by a case study of the Daiyunshan Nature Reserve. Following proposal was provided: The Daiyunshan Nature Reserve should be extended towards northwest and southeast, with an extension of 6 km towards the northwest and an horizontal extension of 18 km; an extension of 9 km towards the southeast and a horizontal extension of 8 km. The proposed method presents a new idea for the theory and practice of planning and design of protected areas in China. © 2018, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

So, it is important to determine suitable places for tourism to better manage the study area. The aim of this study is to identify potential ecotourism sites using ordered weight averaging (OWA) and fuzzy quantifier algorithms in the north of Fars province, Iran. Required spatial data such as geology, soil, slope land, topographic roughness index (TRI), vegetation, surface water, elevation, protected area, climate, distance to road, and distance to the village were utilized. To prepare ecotourism maps with different confidence levels, eleven ordered weights were applied corresponding to the eleven parameters that were rank-ordered for each parameter after the modified factor weights were applied. Also, the feature selection algorithm (random search and genetic search methods) was used to select the most important parameters to determine the ecotourism map. The results showed that, with decreasing risk (α = 0), almost all of the study area was unsuitable for ecotourism while, with increasing risk (α = 20), all of the study areas were suitable for ecotourism. One of the ecotourism maps prepared with different confidence levels can be suggested based on the different conditions of tourists so that, if the tourist has a limited time, ecotourism maps with a higher degree of confidence levels are recommended and vice versa. This is one of the innovations of the present research. Also, the results of the random search method with the least error show that slope, elevation, climate, distance to river, and distance to road parameters are the most important parameters in preparing the ecotourism map of the region. So, using the results of the research, many economic problems, such as unemployment, will be solved by managers by preparing tourism maps and creating service jobs for tourists. With the OWA method, tourism zoning maps can be controlled by managers in order to provide better services and social and economic justice. © 2020","Feature selection algorithm; Fuzzy quantifier algorithm; North of Fars province; Ordered weighted averaging (OWA); Potential ecotourism site","Fars; Iran; algorithm; ecotourism; environmental protection; multicriteria analysis; sustainable development; tourism economics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091193595"

Following a change in federal government, the system underwent two major revisions: an independent review released in 2015, and a final plan designed by the Director of National Parks implemented in 2018. We used all three iterations of the NRSMPA, from 2012 to 2018, to compare: 1. the MPA zoning composition, using IUCN protected area categories; 2. the achievement of goals for representing biophysical features; and 3. the potential to mitigate threats to biodiversity from commercial fishing and offshore petroleum extraction. We found that protection levels in the NRSMPA were downgraded in 2018, compared to 2012 and 2015 iterations. Although each iteration met its qualitative goals, the lack of quantitative goals meant that representation of biophysical features was highly uneven and dominated by MPAs offering little protection against the impacts of extractive uses. Moreover, existing areas with value for pelagic longlining, demersal trawling, and offshore petroleum extraction were largely avoided by MPAs, irrespective of their biophysical features. MPAs, especially those with high protection, resulted in little forgone fisheries catch and revenue, likely providing few safeguards for species threatened by fishing. Changes in the NRSMPA over time have left more areas open to fishing, particularly pelagic fishing and notably in the Coral Sea. By focusing on meeting poorly defined representation goals instead of threat reduction, changes to the NRSMPA over time have increased the exposure of Australia's marine biodiversity to known threats. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Fishing; Marine protected areas; Petroleum; Representation; Threats","Australia; Coral Sea; Pacific Ocean; biodiversity; commercial species; Commonwealth of Nations; demersal fishery; federal system; fishing; government; longlining; marine ecosystem; national park; offshore application; pelagic fishery; policy implementation; protected area; Red List","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095950505"

The knowledge limitations may partly be due to the fact that marine algal species have not been a major focus of surveys and monitoring programmes. This study applied a mixed methods approach for developing an adequate understanding of the status of marine algal species occurring in the An Thoi coral reef strictly protected zone of Phu Quoc MPA. 41 marine algal species were fully described, along with details about habitats, biodiversity, economic and conservation values, and challenges to the conservation of these species. Three of 41 species recorded are listed in the Vietnam Red Data Book, a list of rare and endangered floral and faunal species native to Vietnam. This listing adds a new dimension to the literature with regard to distribution and habitats. The remaining species are known to be of economic value. Two islands, which are not strictly protected zones, are home to two vulnerable algal species. Marine algal species have been poorly managed and monitored as a consequence of insufficient legal frameworks, resulting in little documentation of the effects of socio-economic and tourism development on the marine algal species. The current zoning plan should be revised to expand core zones for the effective management of the algal species.

In Mexico, the current environmental legal and regulatory framework allows mining to take place within specific categories of natural protected areas. However, no information is available on the location and type of mining currently in operation throughout the federal system of natural protected areas in Mexico. This paper is the first study addressing the regulatory framework, spatial distribution, nature, and scale of operation of mining activities in federal natural protected areas in Mexico (FNPA). We surveyed those FNPAs where mining is allowed and characterized mining activities in each in terms of mineral type, scale of operation, and status. Also, we explored the modalities whereby zoning schemes allow mining in these FNPAs, as well as the potential implications for conservation. We found that 30 out of 177 FNPAs explicitly allow mining; in all but seven, some sort of mining activity was identified; these activities differed in type, scale, and status. To note, large-scale open-pit metallic mines operate in two FNPAs, while large-scale non-metallic mines are located in four. Exploration projects and smaller mining operations involving both metallic and non-metallic minerals are currently underway in other FNPAs.

We investigated the influence of environmental and anthropogenic variables on habitat use by humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and Bryde's whales Balaenoptera brydei off the coast of the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. Although there are 2 marine protected areas (MPAs) in this area, few data are available on cetacean habitat use or on the overlap of different cetacean species within these MPAs. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of the MPAs and propose a buffer zone to better protect the biodiversity of the study area. We conducted systematic surveys and developed spatial eigenvector generalized linear models to characterize habitat use by the species in the study area. Habitat use by humpback whales was influenced only by depth, whereas for Bryde's whales there was the additional influence of anthropogenic variables. For Bryde's whales, which use the area for feeding, sea surface temperature and the distance to anchorages had a major influence on habitat use. We also showed that neither of the MPAs in the study area adequately protects the hotspots of either whale species. Most of the humpback whale grid cells with high sighting predictions were located within 2 km of the MPAs, while areas of high sighting prediction of Bryde's whales were located up to 5 km from the MPAs, closer to beaches.

Hailed as a success globally, the rezoning of Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in 2004 was complex and controversial. Despite substantial research within the Marine park, little rigorous evaluation has been undertaken of the rezoning's biological impact - the difference increased protection has made to biodiversity relative to that expected without protection. We review available data of measures of biological impact from ‘new’ no-take zones established in the rezoning and those established under previous zoning. We found 48 studies reporting 782 measures of impact based on comparisons of biological indicators in no-take zones with fished areas. Overwhelmingly, impacts were neutral (57%) or positive (33%). Few data supported causal relationships between new no-take zones and improvements in biological indicators (48 of 159 impacts). The probability of a positive impact increased with time from establishment of no-take zones. Limited conclusions can be drawn from other data. We evaluated whether these measures of impact were robust based on analysis of six key principles of impact evaluation. Sampling was not designed to support causal inferences. Biological monitoring and evaluation designs were limited in providing evidence of the impact of protection. Improved methods that include credible counterfactual data can address limitations of current practice.

To achieve a sustainable ecological management regime in Zhengzhou City, this study presented a comprehensive framework for identifying dynamic changes of ES supply and demand and managing ES. Using land use data of Zhengzhou City in 1995, 2005, and 2015 and incorporating expert knowledge and the ES evaluation matrix, we evaluated the spatiotemporal changes in the ES supply and demand in Zhengzhou. Gradient analysis was conducted to identify urban-rural patterns in the budgets of ES supply and demand. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was employed to identify the hotspot areas of ES surpluses or deficits. The research results show the following: (1) In the past 20 years, the supply-and-demand relationship of ES in Zhengzhou has gradually evolved in a direction where supply falls short of demand. The average budget index of Zhengzhou's ES supply and demand decreased from 7.30 in 1995 to -4.89 in 2015. Changes in the supply and demand status of ES in Zhengzhou corresponded to the background of rapid urbanization. (2) Urban-rural gradient differences exist in the budgets of ES supply and demand in Zhengzhou. Core development areas, such as the Zhengzhou urban areas, are in deficit, whereas a balance or surplus can be observed in rural areas far from urban centers. (3) The surplus hotspots of ES budgets were mainly distributed in the western and southern mountainous areas of Zhengzhou, and they were scattered and the scope shrank, with a decrease of 2.73 times in 20 years, whereas the deficit hotspots expanded outward with each urban area as the center, with an increase of 5.77%. Ecological management zoning (ecological conservation area, ecological improvement area, and ecological reconstruction area) with the effective guidance of ecological and economic policies could comprehensively improve ES management and achieve urban sustainability. The framework in this study can easily and quickly assess the supply and demand status of ES and provide scientific support for the ecological management in rapidly urbanizing areas. © 2020 by the authors.","Ecosystem services; Land use; Supply and demand; Urbanization; Zhengzhou city","China; Henan; Zhengzhou; demand analysis; ecosystem service; environmental management; protected area; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; urban area; urban-rural migration; urbanization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085104449"

In order to regionalize its functions, the needs of various protected objects should be considered comprehensively. Evaluating the functional zoning of the forest ecosystem nature reserve is conducive to improving the protection effectiveness of it. In this study, we took the functional division of Henan Liankangshan National Nature Reserve, a forest ecosystem type nature reserve, as the research object. From December 2016 to December 2018, we conducted surveys of Line transect and infrared-trigger camera in this nature reserve to obtain the distribution point data of Reeves's pheasant and the related species. Combined with the collected environmental data, we preformed the distribution and the species interacting of Reeves's pheasant ( Syrmaticus reevesii) by MaxEnt model. Furthermore, the spatial relationship between species and functional zoning of the nature reserve was analyzed, as well as the spatial relationship between the distribution of wild animals and the intensity of human disturbance in the nature reserve. Then, we evaluated the protection effectiveness of the Liankangshan National Nature Reserve existing functional zoning for the Reeves' s pheasant and the species interacting of Reeves's pheasant. The results show that the area of high protection value area in this nature reserve is 33.84 km2, and the area of high protection value in core area, buffer zone and experimental area account for 18.96%, 3.84% and 9. 19% of the nature reserve respectively. The area ratio of high protection value area is relatively low in Liankangshan National Nature Reserve. The existing functional zoning of the reserve does not fully meet the need to protect the habitat of the Reeves's pheasant. The core area, buffer zone and experimental area are faced with different degrees of human disturbance, which poses a potential threat to the survival of the key protected objects in the nature reserve. Therefore, according to the present situation of protection value and human disturbance distribution, two different functional zoning optimization schemes of Reeves's pheasant were put forward. On the premise of not reducing the area of Liankangshan National Nature Reserve, increase the proportion of the suitable habitat area of Reeves's pheasant and related species in the core protection area, while reduce the intensity of human disturbance in the protection area. This study could provide decision-making basis for the protection of Reeves' s pheasant in Liankangshan National Nature Reserve and provide guidance for the optimization of functional zoning of other nature reserve with wild animals as the protection goal. © 2020 Science Press.

A phenomenon of expanding demand for ocean space as a resource that is in limited supply is most pronounced in coastal marine environments. Intense competition for ocean space among human users in near-shore waters leads inevitably to disputes. Because the private ownership of ocean space usually is unauthorized, ocean space may be allocated through collective action. Present practice involves the political allocation of ocean space for specific purposes; such allocations are known as ocean zoning.

Although it is UNESCO policy to measure the number of BRs that have interactions with urban areas, there has been no systematic assessment of urban biospheres since 2008. This research addresses this deficit by measuring the extent of urbanisation of all designated BRs within the European Union (EU). Using the Copernicus Urban Atlas, the proximity of BRs to Functional Urban Areas (FUA) was determined. The results show that 46% (76/167) of BRs are situated within FUAs, including 11% (18/167) entirely within an FUA. The majority (64%) of EU-28 countries have BRs within FUAs. Urban influences on EU-28 BRs are extensive, as 90% are found within 50 km of an FUA. However, integration with urban areas may be lacking as 14% of EU BRs were adjacent to an FUA. Urban pressures are acute for 11% of EU BRs which had multiple FUAs within a 50 km radius. Therefore, urbanisation of BRs is a widespread challenge and recommendations are provided for BRs to function as an information sharing network and develop a new urban strategy. © 2019 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Ecological networks; European Union; Functional Urban Area; Protected areas; Proximity; UNESCO biosphere reserve; Urban Atlas; Urban ecosystems; Urbanisation","biodiversity; biosphere; European Union; protected area; UNESCO; urban ecosystem; urbanization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075009223"

It is shown that the existing natural resources on this territory should be complemented by an appropriate infrastructure and the rules in order to ensure tourism sustainability and development in connection with a high ecological significance of the territory and a heavy demand from visitors. Using landscape approach and methods of geoinformationbased landscape-interpretation mapping, extrapolating the density of different bird species, calculating integral indicators for assessing ornithological resources as well as infrastructure development techniques, we undertook a planning procedure of the birdwatching tourism infrastructure, including trails and observation points. As initial data, we used vegetation and soil maps, topographic maps, space images, data on the density of bird species in different biotopes, and field investigations. We generated the population density maps for each bird species as well as the biotope assessment map for all bird species, based on calculating the sum of the products of densities of each species by the ecological value of the species. Also, the landscape map was used to develop the territorial zoning map, having regard to the possibilities and limitations of constructing trails of different classes. Using spatial cross-matching of the assessment maps for ornithological resources and the trail zoning map, we identified places holding promise for the construction of the birdwatching tourism infrastructure. It is shown that the suggested method provides a means of making a proximate assessment of the territory from different perspectives, based on knowledge of a territory’s landscape structure; it is a prompt and inexpensive technique as contrasted to field investigations of the entire territory; however, it calls for further detailed investigation into promising areas. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","assessment mapping; bird population density; birdwatching; classification of hiking trails; ecological tourism; factorial-dynamical classification of landscapes","Faro [Portugal]; Portugal; Ria Formosa; Aves; biotope; bird; ecotourism; geological mapping; infrastructure planning; land classification; landscape structure; population density; protected area; species diversity; sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007330043"

The purpose of the paper is development of theoretical-methodological and cartographic instruments for identifying homogeneous territorial complexes, which can be grouped based on the similar functional features and represented as strategic instruments for development of the region. The differential matrix method for distinguishing typological structures in the economic complex of the region is the basic research method. This method in turn is based on the targeting method for the purpose of planning development of a region, the structural method aimed at forming clusters on the branch principle and the forecasting method with an eye to determine whether implementation of suggested measures will cause an increase in Gross Regional Product. It’s suggested to implement recreational monitoring based on the concept of recreational digression stages with diversification of tourist product in each natural recreational area and identifying a few cycles of recreational activity, which allow, if conditions changed, refocusing recreational activity to a different, optimum direction and creating cross-border protected areas, coordinating actions of existing near-border areas.

This diversity is explained in terms of target species, gears, and fishing strategies. The main objective of this work was to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of artisanal SSFs of the future MPA of ""Taza"" (Algeria, SW Mediterranean). Data were collected through direct assessment of daily landings and using questionnaires. They were the subject of multivariate analyses that allowed us to identify the métiers practiced by artisanal fishers. During the one year (May 2013 to April 2014) field work period, 1330 fishing trips and 1613 fishing operations in 16 fishing grounds were recorded in the Ziama fishing harbor, where 15.2 tons of total catch was assessed. Our results show that, in the study area, the boats are predominantly gillnetters and that among the five métiers characterized by target species, gear type, fishing grounds, and fishing seasons, two métiers (""Mullus surmuletus trammel net"" and ""Sparids monofilament gillnet"") are practiced throughout the year, while the remaining three (""Sarda sarda driftnet"", ""Merluccius merluccius set gillnet"", and ""Pagellus set gillnet"") are specific to a determined period of the year. The 'Mullus surmuletus trammel net' métier represents 40% of the total fishing operations, of which 57.5% are carried out in the coastal sector at - 25 m. This study could contribute to defining the appropriate management approaches for SSFs in the future MPA of ""Taza"" by providing baseline information to build a sound management plan. In Algeria, it will certainly serve as a scientific reference in terms of zoning, protection of biodiversity, and specific monitoring at particular locations and periods of the year for the sustainable management of MPAs. © 2018 Mediterranean Marine Science.","Algeria; Marine protected areas; Mediterranean; Small-scale fisheries; Taza","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063968784"

Snapper Chrysophrys auratus are an important recreational and commercial fish species in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, and despite fishery management for this species, they are considered ""growth overfished"" in this region. To assess how C. auratus respond to the implementation of an MPA with several no-take and partially protected areas in temperate NSW, we monitored their populations over a decade (2006-2017) using baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs). Surveys were conducted in the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park with BRUVs deployed on rocky reefs in depths of 20-50 m. Long term seasonal sampling (winter vs. summer) was undertaken at two locations (Broughton and Fingal Island), and changes in C. auratus abundance prior to, and 8 years after zoning implementation, were assessed between these two locations. In total, we sampled five no-take areas within the marine park and five comparative nearby partially protected fished areas and three sites located outside the marine park boundaries. The most pronounced changes in abundance and size structure for C. auratus were observed in the Broughton Island no-take area where numbers increased almost 3-fold (2.91 times) over 8 years of protection. Relative abundance showed seasonal variation at two locations, and we consistently recorded increasing abundance within no-take areas at Broughton and Fingal Island compared to nearby sites open to fishing. Surveys across the five no-take areas found a significant increase in the abundance of C. auratus, whilst the five partially-protected locations in the marine park still recorded higher abundances than sites outside the marine park. In addition, length measurements from stereo-BRUVS indicated that C. auratus were significantly larger in no-take areas compared to partially-protected areas in the marine park and sites outside the marine park. This study demonstrates how the implementation of the marine park and the protection afforded by no-take and partially-protected areas provides refuge for this important fishery targeted species. © 2018 Harasti, Williams, Mitchell, Lindfield and Jordan.","BRUV; Marine reserves; No-take; Pagrus auratus; Partially protected area; Port Stephens","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048630153"

The achievement of these broad conservation objectives will likely require large areas, and stretch limited funds for MPA implementation. We undertook a spatial prioritisation of Brazilian coral reefs that considered two types of conservation zones (i.e. no-take and multiple use areas) and integrated multiple conservation objectives into MPA planning, while assessing the potential impact of different sets of objectives on implementation costs. We devised objectives for biodiversity, connectivity, and resilience to global warming, determined the extent to which existing MPAs achieved them, and designed complementary zoning to achieve all objectives combined in expanded MPA systems. In doing so, we explored interactions between different sets of objectives, determined whether refinements to the existing spatial arrangement of MPAs were necessary, and tested the utility of existing MPAs by comparing their cost effectiveness with an MPA system designed from scratch. We found that MPAs in Brazil protect some aspects of coral reef biodiversity pattern (e.g. threatened fauna and ecosystem types) more effectively than connectivity or resilience to global warming. Expanding the existing MPA system was as cost-effective as designing one from scratch only when multiple objectives were considered and management costs were accounted for. Our approach provides a comprehensive assessment of the benefits of integrating multiple objectives in the initial stages of conservation planning, and yields insights for planners of MPAs tackling multiple objectives in other regions. © 2017 The Authors","Biodiversity conservation; Climate change; Connectivity; Marine reserve; Marine reserve design","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019552839"

It assists in framing decision problems, illustrating the performance of alternatives across criteria, exploring trade-offs, formulating a decision and testing its robustness. This paper provides a structured review of empirical applications of MCDA to nature conservation published in the scientific literature over the last 20 years. The paper aims at taking stock of past experiences, and comparing them with best practices and common pitfalls identified in the literature, to provide recommendations for better MCDA application to conservation. The review follows the structure of a generalized MCDA process consisting of three key stages: (1) decision context and problem structuring, (2) analysis and (3) decision. The search identified 86 papers that describe MCDA applications to a range of topics, including conservation prioritization and planning; protected areas management and zoning; forest management and restoration; and mapping of biodiversity, naturalness and wilder. The results show that, concerning problem structuring, a small percentage of the reviewed MCDA engaged stakeholders other than the authors in identifying alternatives and formulating criteria (15% and 35% respectively). Concerning the analysis, criteria assessment was adequately justified by the authors (47%), at times also by involving other stakeholders (22%). Weighting was performed in almost all applications, whereas criteria aggregation was mostly based on the weighted linear combination (63%). Sensitivity analysis was largely overlooked (57%). Concerning decision, 45% of the articles provided only an overall ranking or suitability of alternatives, while 22% included additional rankings according to specific criterion, and 8% further analyses and clustering of stakeholders’ preferences. The paper concludes by suggesting key elements of successful MCDA applications, including clear construction of the decision context; collaborative identification of alternatives and criteria that reflect the values at stake; adequate justification and communication of the methods for criteria assessment and weighting; reasoned choice of the criteria aggregation method, and comprehensive sensitivity analysis. © 2018 The Authors.

Environmental reporting on China has tended to focus on environment damage, especially air pollution. Relatively unnoticed in the West, however, China has invested in improving and expanding its system of protected areas. These protected areas follow varied models—they include nature reserves, forest parks, wetland parks, and more—and face challenges roughly similar to those of protected areas in the United States and many other countries. Unsurprisingly, though, there are important differences that make China's protected area program uniquely Chinese. Chinese protected areas have been largely created and continue to be developed with strong top-down authority, although national-level control is softening and other models are being tested. Several nature reserves have received influxes of government funding in recent years to improve and expand their infrastructure and activities to support conservation, tourism, and other uses. Chinese nature reserves also tend to have explicit zoning and economic activities designed to promote economic development in and around them; this emphasis on economic development is greater and takes a different approach in Chinese parks than is typical in Western park systems. Here we compare aspects of the Chinese and US investments in national parks and national nature reserves; we use two examples—Wudalianchi National Nature Reserve in China and Acadia National Park in the United States—to highlight similarities and differences. We conclude that each country's approach to protected areas has strengths and weaknesses in terms of conservation value, engagement with local communities, and sustainability, but that overall each country's protected areas program has structural deficiencies, particularly related to the allocation of funding, that undermine their ability to achieve their stated mission over the long term. The shortcomings in each country are different and may not be as substantial as the shortcomings of` national parks in many other countries, but they are critical nonetheless. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Acadia National Park; Economic development; Investments; Protected areas; US National Park Service; Wudalianchi National Nature Reserve","Acadia National Park; China; Heilongjiang; Maine; United States; Wudalianchi National Park; comparative study; conservation status; economic development; environmental economics; governance approach; investment; local participation; nature reserve; protected area; valuation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992445786"

However, these data are often scant, as exemplified by the Port Stephens estuary, part of the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park (NSW, Australia), for which even basic descriptions of habitat types and extent are lacking. Herein we present the results of the first quantitative assessment of subtidal benthic communities within the estuary, involving 130km of towed video transects over an area exceeding 50km2. We identified previously undocumented macroalgae-dominated habitat types and found strong correlations between habitat types and depth. The soft coral Dendronephthya australis habitat is of particular interest because this was found to occur exclusively outside current sanctuary (no take) zones. The habitat map of Port Stephens generated during the study provides the basis for more objective representative planning in future iterations of zoning in the estuarine section of the marine park. The study also suggests that depth may be a useful proxy for estuarine habitat types where specific data are lacking. The classification methodology developed during the study was cost-effective, generated robust data and consequently has potential for wider application in other large estuarine bays. © CSIRO 2016.","conservation management; habitat mapping; marine protected area; Port Stephens; structural macrobiota; towed video","Australia; New South Wales; Port Stephens; Alcyonacea; Dendronephthya; biodiversity; classification; conservation management; estuarine environment; habitat management; habitat type; macrobenthos; mapping; marine park; soft coral; subtidal environment; typology; videography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84980361843"

The implementation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) has become a cornerstone in addressing these impacts. The formulation of the Aichi Target (AT) 11 has acknowledged the benefits of MPAs as a vital approach to achieve marine conservation targets. In the AT 11, reference to the term “equitably managed” has demonstrated the importance of equity in the planning and management of MPAs and in this paper, a description of how equity should be considered from the inception stage is detailed. Two case studies, one in Japan and the other in the Solomon Islands, were chosen because they include equity considerations from the inception and were successful in reaching their conservation targets. Through these two case studies, it is demonstrated that understanding the objectives and expectations of all stakeholders can help achieve the qualitative goals of the AT 11. This is particularly true for local and indigenous communities in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and coastal communities in developing countries.

It is an overseas collectivity of the French Republic with administrative autonomy. Nearly 276,000 inhabitants are spread between five archipelagos (Australs, Gambier, Marquesas, Society, and Tuamotu) that have very different natural characteristics. Most people live in the Windward group of the Society, where Papeete, the capital, is found on the largest island, Tahiti. Climate is tropical to subtropical. Coral reefs and lagoons are extensive with substantial resources. Tourism, black pearl farming, and fisheries are the main economic resources. Environmental degradation and problems occur due to coastal developments that can be island and archipelago dependent. The effects of global warming and anomalous climatic conditions have been seen for two decades, with several coral bleaching and mortality episodes in lagoons. In the same period, coral reefs have also experienced natural disturbances such as cyclones and Acanthaster outbreaks, as well as human-induced degradations. Thus far, the French Polynesian reefs appear to be resilient to these disturbances, at least the forereefs. Marine conservation programs are numerous and increasing, from existing locally managed areas to planned giant marine protected areas. Several entire atolls and islands are fully protected or benefit from a zoning plan. The economy is fragile and the challenges due to distance and isolation are numerous, but French Polynesia benefits from a moderately growing population, moderately exploited marine resources, strong governmental and private technical capacities, resilient reefs, extensive history of research and documentation, and numerous other environmental and cultural assets. In comparison to other Pacific Island Countries and Territories, French Polynesia is in a favorable position to anticipate and adapt to a global change and a globally changing world. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Current regulations are usually based on the determination of the horizontal groundwater travel time component, while the vertical component is commonly neglected. Karst aquifers are especially sensitive to contamination through the unsaturated zone, and consequently numerous methods for determining intrinsic vulnerability have been developed. Many of these methods take into account the effects in the unsaturated zone, but mostly by indirect means. Vulnerability assessment methods do not fully reflect the component of groundwater residence time, making groundwater delineation zoning more difficult, with possible ambiguous and subjective results. Therefore, a method that incorporates the two equally important components (horizontal and vertical) is needed to facilitate groundwater protection zoning. The time-dependent model represents a redesigned vulnerability assessment method, created for karst aquifers, to incorporate the travel time component. This model incudes horizontal and vertical groundwater flow components and also considers a surface component toward ponor zones. The baseline for groundwater travel time through the unsaturated zone was adopted from the Time–input method. The estimation of the horizontal travel time component was based on the conceptual duality of flow in karst aquifers, which has fast and slow components. For the allogenic part of the karst aquifer catchment area (subcatchments of the ponor zone) travel time components were estimated according to different influencing factors e.g. slope, soil type, vegetation, and rainfall intensity. This methodology was tested on the case example of the Crnica karst source located at the western part of the Kučaj anticline in Eastern Serbia. The methodology was shown to be more accurate and appropriate for the delineation of the groundwater protection zones than existing approaches. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Groundwater protection zoning; Groundwater source protection; Karst aquifer; Time-dependent model (TDM)","Serbia; Aquifers; Catchments; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Groundwater pollution; Hydrogeology; Landforms; Travel time; Zoning; Current regulations; Ground water protection; Groundwater residence time; Groundwater source protection; Karst aquifer; Sanitary protection zone; Time-dependent models; Vulnerability assessments; aquifer; assessment method; catchment; groundwater flow; groundwater resource; karst; protected area; residence time; time dependent behavior; travel time; vulnerability; Groundwater resources","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84985930757"

Officially designated in spring 2012, the boundaries for these ecologically sensitive areas (ESAs) were based on best professional judgment and a geographic information system-based assessment using extant maps of habitat natural features, including shellfish beds, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), presence of endangered species, and proximity to bird nesting areas. The need for and the subsequent effectiveness of ESA designation in managing the adverse effects of recreational boating activities were evaluated. Two indicators of boating usage and impact were mapped using visual interpretation of high-spatial-resolution aerial photography: (1) concentrations of boating activity (either moored or in transit) and (2) damage caused by both propeller-driven and personal watercraft-type boats to SAV habitats. The mapping clearly shows extensive prop scarring, with hot spots of damage in specific ESAs, confirming that some form of spatial zoning, with slow speed regulations or outright closures, are warranted to protect SAV. The mapping documents significant levels of boating usage and boat scarring still occurring within the ESAs postdesignation. Additional management actions to reduce boating impacts are clearly warranted. To reach a spectrum of the recreational boating community, a three-pronged approach that includes public education in responsible boating practices, placement of appropriate signage at the ESA boundaries, and routine enforcement by state marine police and conservation officers is recommended. © 2017 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc.","coastal ecosystem management; colonial nesting birds; Ecologically sensitive areas; MPAs; seagrass; submerged aquatic vegetation","Barnegat Bay; New Jersey; United States; Aves; aerial photography; boating; coastal zone management; education; endangered species; GIS; protected area; seagrass; submerged vegetation; visual analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038349389"

Conflicting therewith, the protected area is an important tourist attraction in the region and receives many visitors throughout the year. For the zoning preparation, the main factors and constraints of each objective (ecotourism and conservation) are established, and a multicriteria analysis is used, in addition to the MOLA (Multi-Objective Land Allocation) algorithm, to establish the most suitable areas for each use. Extreme protection areas are defined through the intersection of endemic vegetation and soils and altitudes above 1,500 m. Thus, a fraction of 18% is obtained for extreme protection, 59% for conservation, and 23% for areas destined for ecotourism development. The results demonstrate the advantages of using these methods, due to their simplicity, which can support administrators in planning the protected area. The zoning is in accordance with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recommendation because the conservation area corresponds to approximately 77% of the park area, reinforcing the suitability and applicability of the methodology that is used for the zoning of a protected area. © 2016, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

Desert ecosystems perform irreplaceable eco-service functions, providing protection against wind, stabilizing sand, acting as biogeographic barriers, and promoting the conservation of biodiversity. Moreover, vegetation plays a crucial role in the assessment of ecological changes. Accordingly, by analyzing changes in vegetation, ecological threats can be identified and their severity quantified, thus helping to assess conservation efficacy in nature reserves. China is one of several countries worldwide suffering from severe desertification over vast areas, that is both extensive and complex. Accordingly, it is critical to understand conservation efficacy in the desert ecosystems of China's nature reserves. The Gansu Anxi National Nature Reserve in Hyper-Arid Desert (GANNR) is the only reserve in China established to protect hyper-arid desert ecosystems and their biodiversity, it is located in Guazhou County in the western part of the Hexi Corridor, Gansu Province. GANNR covers approximately 8000 km2, and thus accounts for one third of the total area of Guazhou County. The reserve separates the Kumutage and Badain Jaran deserts, sheltering the Hexi Corridor oasis and preventing sandstorms. Accordingly, it plays a critical role in biodiversity conservation and regional eco-safety. GANNR is divided into two parts: the northern and southern reserves. As the Chinese government has implemented its western development strategy, some key national projects have extended across the northern part of GANNR, including infrastructure for west-east natural gas transmission, west-east power transmission, and the Lan-Xin railway. In this study, we selected the southern part of GANNR as our study area for several reasons: (1) the vegetation cover and species richness are higher here than in the north, (2) typical temperate desert vegetation such as Reaumuria soongorica, Salsola passerina, Sympegma regelii, and Ephedra przewalskii can be found and assessed in the south, and (3) some villages are located in the southern part of our study zone. We analyzed trends in vegetative growth from 2000 to 2010, using RS and GIS by combining vegetation type and functional zoning maps. The vegetation type map was created using a high-resolution remote sensing image, which was acquired from the ZY-1-02C satellite in August 2012. This image had a spatial resolution of 2.36 m, after processing in ENVI 5.0 using orthorectification and the Gram-Schmidt method. Regression analysis of NDVI and elapsed time revealed the vegetation growth trend for each vegetation type in different functional zones. The results show the following: (1) each vegetation type exhibited increased growth over time, with an increasing trend during the 11-year period. This was particularly true for the natural grassland, which included Alhagi sparsifolia, Phragmites australis, and Achnatherum splendens, (2) no degraded vegetation types were found in either the core zone or the buffer zone, indicating that the GANNR administration achieved their protection goal, and (3) degraded vegetation types were found in the Bulongji, Qiaozi, and Shuangta villages, covering an area of 1319 hm2, this corresponds to just 0.31% of the study area. Although we have clearly demonstrated the vegetation conservation efficacy in GANNR, we also make the following suggestions: (1) adjust the functional zoning, such that the area containing Ephedra przewalskii is incorporated into the buffer or core zones, and (2) strengthen supervision around the villages to maintain the grassland conservation results achieved previously by constructing a fence to return grazing land to grass. We hope that this study will be beneficial to the GANNR administration, and will act as a reference for future vegetation conservation efficacy assessments. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

At the same time, discharge of water pollutants and exploitation of water resources pose a daunting challenge to the sustainable development of economy and society. China consists of 34 provincial administrative regions having similar or different characteristics in the levels of economic development, water resource endowment, water environmental capacity and water environmental pressure. Among these, it is meaningful to analyze spatial similarities and variations in water environmental carrying capacity (WECC), which contributes to carrying out different and scientific strategies for the management of water environment and for sustainable economic and social development in China. An index system is established to quantify WECC from the perspectives of carrying capacity, environmental pressure, vulnerability of water environment and exploitation and utilization potential. The k-means clustering method is applied to conduct the similarity combination based on the quantification of 4 integrated indicators using catastrophe progression method. The silhouette coefficient is introduced to measure the quality of clustering and to determine the optimal clustering number. The obtained results indicate that carrying condition of water environment becomes more and more better and exploitation and utilization potential of WECC is decreasing gradually from the east to the west in China, and there are more overload in the north provinces and less in the south. In addition, water environmental vulnerability in the west is higher than that of central and eastern provinces in China. The optimal clustering number is 4 obtained by calculating the silhouette coefficient. Also, 31 provinces are categorized into 4 sub-areas i.e. key protected area, controlled development area, optimized development area and prioritized development area. The suggestions on the corresponding bidirectional regulation to different sub-areas are also put forward to provide a scientific reference to rational distribution of economic development, elaborate management of water environment as well as regional sustainable development in the future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","China; k-means clustering zoning; Spatial differences; Sustainable development; Water environmental carrying capacity","China; Clustering algorithms; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Planning; Water conservation; Water management; Water pollution; water; Catastrophe progression method; China; Environmental carrying capacities; Exploitation of water resources; K - means clustering; Regional sustainable development; Spatial differences; Water environmental capacities; carrying capacity; economic growth; future prospect; resource development; sustainability; sustainable development; water management; water resource; Article; China; environmental carrying capacity; geographic distribution; regionalization; social evolution; sustainable development; water environmental carrying capacity; water supply; Sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044728558"

In this context, marine protected areas can be counted as legal instruments to ensure proper use of natural resources and promote sustainable development. One of the main aspects for the management of protected areas is environmental zoning. Despite its importance, there are few studies focusing on environmental zoning in semiarid coastal environments. The purpose of this study was to present a case study on environmental zoning of a protected area located in the Environmental Protection Area of the Curú River estuary, which is located on the semiarid coast of the South Atlantic Ocean in Ceará-Brazil. The research was conducted in accordance with the classification criteria used in the Ecological-Economic Zoning (EEZ) of the Coastal Zone, a legal instrument that is important with regards to the Brazilian coast. The work was performed with a GIS technique and involved field activities. The results suggest the following environmental systems within the perimeter of the protected area: river plain, fluvial-marine plain with mangroves, fixed dunes, plain deflation/mobile dunes, plain deflation/fixed dunes, pre-coastal vegetation, and sandspit. The maps of the environmental systems zoning were developed on a 1:40,000 scale and were made to encourage the sustainable use of natural resources. As pressure on the environment by human activities increases, it is essential to update environmental zoning in protected areas, especially in the coastal areas of developing countries.","Coastal ecosystems; Ecological-Economic Zoning; Management; Mangroves","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964354684"

Nevertheless, human activities in and around protected areas produce anthropogenic noise that is difficult to mitigate and control. To assess the efficacy of protected area zoning in preserving natural soundscapes, controlling anthropogenic noise intrusion, and conserving biodiversity in El Yunque National Forest, Puerto Rico, I simultaneously sampled three management zones (protected, recreational, and buffer) with passive acoustic monitoring and conducted a soundscape analysis. There was no difference in the overall acoustic space used among the three management areas, but compositional differences among the soundscapes were detected. Such variation was related to differences in species composition along the elevation gradient, habitat transformation, and anthropogenic noise. Anthropogenic noise was more conspicuous in the buffer and recreational areas, where many bird species are classified as highly vulnerable to noise. Although the management zones in El Yunque National Forest were not created for the purpose of noise control, management is shown to be useful for minimizing noise intrusion in the strictly protected zone. In recreational and buffer areas, complementary strategies such as traffic limitations, limiting access to specific areas, and noise reduction educational programs should be implemented to maintain the natural soundscape while conserving biodiversity. Finally, the noise vulnerability classification proposed in this study could be a useful tool for assisting managers and researchers in defining priority strategies for sensitive species that require special attention and protection. © The Author(s) 2018.","acoustic space use; noise pollution; noise vulnerability classification; passive acoustic monitoring; protected area management","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072737263"

The trend is typical for a new Russian territory – the Crimean Peninsula. The article presents results of analysis of current structure of natural resource use in PAs of the Crimean Peninsula that is represented by 208 objects. The current PAs system of Crimea along with its structure by categories, number of objects and their areas is demonstrated. The maximum PAs area is accounted for wildlife refuges (zakazniks) and nature reserves – the objects of strict protection (75%). The data also provided on the dynamics of PAs system formation from 2000 to 2014. It was indicated the increase in number of protected areas by 46%, and their area by 57%. Proportion for the areas covered by PAs in each administrative unit of the Crimean Peninsula has been calculated. It was found that the proportion of protected areas is higher in the urban districts. Bakhchisarai district with PAs ratio above 10% stands out from the other peninsula districts. In seven districts protected areas has not been established yet. A wide range of land use types is indicated for wildlife refuges and natural monuments. Types of natural resource use are identified, which are represented in protected areas of the Crimean Peninsula (a case of Baidarskii Reserve), and their spatial structure is demonstrated. The main types of nature resource use in Baidarskii Reserve are recreational, forestry, agricultural and residential. At the same time, special attention has been paid to the geoecological problems that have arisen because of different types of nature resource use. Agriculture caused transformation of vegetation, soils, and pasture digression. Recreational use of natural resources contributed to changing the composition and structure of plant communities, along with transforming density of upper soil layers. Recreational load is localized mainly along touristic trails.","Baidarskii Reserve; Ecological network; Functional zoning; Natural resource use; Natural resource use structure; Recreation; Recreational load; Reserve; Specially protected areas (PAs); The Crimean Peninsula","Crimea; Crimean Mountains; Russian Federation; Ukraine; agricultural practice; community structure; ecological zonation; economic activity; forestry; land use; natural resource; nature reserve; plant community; protected area; recreational activity; refuge; resource use; wildlife management; zoning policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040829869"

A substantial share of these forests is dedicated to nature conservation, with an extensive protected area network connected by biological corridors. Forestlands are also partly allocated to timber production, including forest management units subjected to strict regulations. We assessed the effectiveness of these various land-use zoning units to protect forest cover. We used a matching procedure to control for covariates and obtain robust estimates of the impact of each type of unit on forest cover changes during the 2000s. We also investigated subsets of the protected area network to test for effectiveness heterogeneities within this network. Our results showed that protected areas prevented 63% of the forest loss expected in forestlands under this protection status. These units also curtailed forest gain. Long-established protected areas were more effective at avoiding forest loss than recent ones, while the levels of stringency and operationality of protected areas had no differentiable impact on forest loss. We detected more forest loss in forests surrounding protected areas compared to more distant forestlands, showing a leakage effect. Biological corridors had no impact on forest loss and gain. Forest management units decreased forest loss by half. After accounting for the selection bias, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of land use zoning for forest conservation in Bhutan. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Caliper; Confounding variables; Conservation; Counterfactual; Deforestation; Impact evaluation; Park; Quasi-experimental; Tropical forest","Bhutan; deforestation; environmental protection; experimental study; forest cover; forest management; forestry production; land use change; nature conservation; tropical forest; zoning policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047563686"

Method: We used a combination of questionnaire survey with local communities for ranking the hunted mammal species as bushmeat and track surveys in gridded-cell system of 500x500 m2 (n=268) to assess at what extend the management design, the anthropogenic factors and habitat type affect the occupancy model of those mammal species. Results: Twenty mammal species have been predominantly reported by the local inhabitants to consume bushmeat species and 5 of them have been identified as the most preferable as hunted game mammals. The selection of the preferred habitat among the swampy forest, the dense forest, the tree plantations and cropland for the prioritized game species varies between species but looks similar when grouping in different orders. Some bushmeat species were found to select the more secure habitat (natural forest); suggesting the zoning system in the Lama forest can passively protect those species. However, some species such as T. swinderianus although highly hunted showed preference to anthropogenic habitat, avoiding the well secured core zone in Lama Forest. Conclusion: Our findings highlighted the importance of the zoning system with different management objectives in the habitat occupancy model of the highly hunted wildlife species. © 2018 Djagoun et al.","Hunted; Mammal; Multiple use areas; Wildlife","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045197093"

Most protected areas have been designated during the past decades and comply with strict territorial considerations: they have strong local roots and are very narrowly defined due to the negotiation processes involved in determining the demarcation, as well as the established administrative boundaries and precise zoning. This method is implicitly based on the assumption of the constancy and immutability of the natural and social environment of protected areas. The following article calls this into question and reveals that the territorial concept of protected areas appears difficult to sustain in light of the complex processes of a constantly changing environment on the one hand, and when viewed against the background of ever expanding nature conservation objectives, on the other hand. Furthermore, the contribution confronts essential underlying assumptions of nature conservation with complexity-theoretical considerations and illustrates that the basic assumptions pertaining to nature conservation require a fundamental revision, which would also have far-reaching consequences in practical conservation work. The considerations are presented within a framework provided by the thesis of the Anthropocene, which fundamentally challenges established dualisms such as nature/culture. © 2018 Austrian Geographical Society.

However, SCP exercises have been criticized for “knowing but not doing”, i.e. not implementing the proposed reserve. But there is an additional problem that can be called “knowing but not knowing”, knowing things from databases, but not knowing crucial contextual information about community-based social processes that have supported the high forest cover and biodiversity detected. Examined here is how a common property region of the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca, Mexico has maintained high forest cover in the absence of public protected areas, while multiple SCP exercises have advocated for the creation of public protected areas in communal tropical montane cloud forests and pine forests as strategies for biodiversity conservation and resilience to climate change. Methods included archival research, review of community documents, focus group interviews, semi-structured interviews, participant observation, land use transects, and GIS analysis and remote sensing. Conservation in the region originally occurred because of low population densities, steep slopes and a lack of agricultural subsidies, supported by locally adapted agricultural practices. In the 1990s, a transition from passive to active conservation took place with land use zoning plans, community conservation rules, community forestry enterprises and payments for environmental service programs that consolidated a trend towards high, unthreatened forest cover. Today, the study communities have an average of 88.3% forest cover, with 61% of that in informal conservation based on community land use zoning and rules and another 14% governed by forest management plans approved by the Mexican government. We argue that truly systematic conservation plans would seek to understand how communities in the region are already managing forests for conservation. It is pointless and uninformed to advocate for top-down conservation interventions of forests that are already robustly conserved and resilient to climate change due to community action. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity conservation; Community conservation; Mexico; Oaxaca; Systematic conservation planning","Mexico [North America]; Oaxaca; Sierra Norte de Oaxaca; biodiversity; coniferous forest; conservation planning; forest cover; forest management; montane forest; protected area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84989853906"

In the marine and coastal realms, targets have been successful in setting sustainable limits to fisheries harvests, thresholds for pollutants, and recommended amounts of representative habitat included in marine protected area (MPA) networks. Quantifiable targets can dissuade governments from making dubious claims about investments in ocean protection that sound impressive but cannot be verified. Examples are presented where protection targets have been used successfully for marine management, and instances where measurable and meaningful benchmarks serve to allow tracking of true progress. However, the setting of targets can also be a double-edged sword. In some cases, targets have proven useful, but in many instances, interventions made to fulfil targets not only give a false illusion of progress or even success, they present opportunity costs that impede further conservation. Some of these issues were raised in the 2003 article ‘Dangerous Targets?: Unresolved issues and ideological clashes around marine protected areas’ that appeared in Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems. Since its publication, the article's warnings about how targets can sometimes be dangerous and counter-productive have led to intense debate among scientists and policy-makers alike, and the paper has been cited in more than 500 publications. Yet today, more than a dozen years after the first ‘Dangerous Targets' publication, new targets are driving more MPA designations and conservation strategies than ever before, and the ‘dangerous’ aspects of target setting have been largely ignored. This paper discusses old ‘dangers' in the context of new developments in marine conservation, including the lingering problem of having simplistic metrics drive marine policies, and the unintended result that can often occur when outputs (percentage of area under MPA designation) do not align with true outcomes of effective management and conservation. Newly emerging ‘dangers’ in letting areal targets (percentage of area under MPA designation) drive MPA designations are also discussed, including how the rush to fulfil obligations to protect a certain proportion of area is taking place in planning, separate from broader level, and potentially more holistic, marine spatial planning (MSP). The paper suggests five recommendations that would allow policy-makers to use targets more effectively, including: (1) increase transparency in planning, especially around specific goals and objectives of MPA establishment; (2) use time-based areal targets when representativity is a goal of the protected area strategy; (3) use MPAs when spatial protections are the best solution to the management challenge; (4) design MPAs with intrinsic performance goals, and use performance-based metrics in subsequent evaluation of MPAs; and (5) embed MPA planning into broader policy frameworks, including MSP. These five recommendations are oriented toward multilateral institutions, governments, and non-governmental organizations, suggesting concrete ways to utilize target-setting to their best advantage, in order to fight the downward spiral of degradation affecting marine and coastal environments worldwide.

In this paper, an interdisciplinary method combining spatial multi-criteria analysis (SMCA), geographic information system (GIS) and stakeholder consultation to develop a zoning scheme in the multiple-use MPAs of Eritrea is illustrated. Three higher-level criteria and eight lower-level criteria are identified based on the value-focused approach to multi-criteria analysis, and stakeholder preference is represented by pair-wise comparison (AHP analysis). Subsequently, the simple additive weighting (SAW) method is used to determine the suitability of an area for each protection level using spatial analysis software. Through this study, a zoning scheme considering both the scientific soundness and the practical feasibility of the Sheik Seid Marine National Park (SSMNP) in the Eritrean waters is proposed. The method could serve as a model for developing a zoning plan for those similar cases, particularly in the developing countries with data and financial and technical limits. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","GIS; Marine protected areas; Spatial multi-criteria analysis; The Sheik Seid Marine National Park; Zoning","Eritrea; GIS; interdisciplinary approach; marine park; multicriteria analysis; national park; stakeholder","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945293114"

The purpose of this study is to analyze the use of sea space by local fishermen based on fishing gear and fishing ground, as well as evaluation of suitability of fishing ground with zonation system in the conservation area of Kei Kecil Island. The research was conducted in May to August 2017, in 3 fishermen ohoi (village), Matwaer, Somlain and Ohoidertutu. Data collection uses interview techniques and participatory mapping. Data is processed and analyzed based on geographic information system (GIS). The results show the utilization of marine space based on the distribution of fishing gear which is dominated by gill net and lines. The use of marine space based on fishing ground, varies seasonally. Local fishermen categorize seasonally fishing ground based on the distribution of fish catches, include: high season from September to December, middle season from May to August, and low season from January to April. There are three types of fishing ground based on the intensity of space use, covering primary, secondary and tertiary fishing ground. Tertiary fishing grounds have wider space use patterns than other types of fishing ground. In the famine season, fishermen tend to enter core zones, sub-zones of tourism and aquaculture for fishing purposes, means that local fishermen have violated the zonation system on TPK Kei Kecil Island. © 2018, BIOFLUX SRL.

China faces especially strong pressure since many people live inside protected areas. It has sought to balance human needs and conservation goals within them by creating mixed zoning schemes loosely based on UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme. These include strictly-protected core zones, buffer zones allowing limited human use, and experimental zones that examine different land-use options. To test the efficacy of this zoning, we employed field surveys and remote sensing to assess the penetration of agricultural and urban land into 109 national nature reserves in China for 2000 and 2010. Human disturbance was lowest in core zones and highest in experimental zones in both 2000 and 2010. Over this period, 82% of the reserves were unchanged or had decreased human disturbance. Nonetheless, overall human disturbance increased by 7%, 4%, and 5% in the core, buffer and experimental zones respectively. Almost all the increase in the core zone was in four wetland reserves, where human actions converted large areas to agriculture. Some 58% of reserves experienced some human disturbance in core zones in 2010, demonstrating a need for more effective zoning. The findings have broader implications for protected area management globally because they highlight the strengths and weaknesses of zoning for balancing human needs and species conservation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","China; Conservation planning; Nature reserves; Protected area; Zoning","China; anthropogenic effect; conservation planning; conservation status; field survey; nature reserve; remote sensing; species conservation; UNESCO; wetland; zoning policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027928076"

A recent such initiative in the South Atlantic has important social and ecological implications that have not been discussed in existing literature. In light of this knowledge gap, this article aims to discuss the implementation of MPA networks in the St. Peter and St. Paul´s archipelago and the Vitória-Trindade seamount chain (~1000 km from the Brazilian coast). The participatory process conducted by the Brazilian Federal government created LMPAs networks that integrate multiple-use zones centered on certain natural monuments (islands) and spanning a radius of 200 nautical miles around these islands. With these LMPAs (together covering ~920,000 km2), Brazil increases its MPA coverage from 1.5% to ~ 25% of its EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone). However, even with this high percentage of protection, many important coastal ecosystems are not yet protected in Brazilian waters. These LMPAs can be an important step towards the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services of terrestrial insular, shallow, mesophotic, and deep-sea ecosystems. Owing to this importance, it is necessary to ensure adequate surveillance, participative governance, as well as an adequate management plan to deal with the increase in human pressures (fishing, mining, plastics, and climate-change stressors). This paper discusses strategies for the establishment of ocean zoning (including no-take zones) and large-scale marine spatial planning to improve management effectiveness. It also provides insights into the challenges faced in the management of LMPAs in a changing ocean. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Exclusive Economic Zone; Management effectiveness; Marine Protected Area; Ocean governance; Oceanic island","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (South); Brazil; Espirito Santo; Pernambuco; Saint Peter and Saint Paul Rocks; Trindade; Vitoria [Espirito Santo]; ecosystem service; environmental management; governance approach; marine policy; participatory approach; protected area; seamount; spatial planning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045287122"

The model areas were divided into five monitoring zones, graded by conservation importance and habitat disturbance level (core area [A], broader core area [B], semi-natural habitat [C], anthropogenically affected habitat [D], anthropogenically degraded habitat [E]). Despite a high number of IAS occurrences (3222 localities), habitats of European importance (zone A) showed a relatively low level of invasion (< 0.3% total area). Highest IAS occurrence number was in SCI border areas and disturbed habitats (zones C and E). There was a significant positive correlation between level of invasion inside and outside SCIs, related to human activities such as logging and urbanisation. A strong effect for watercourse vicinity was noted for the occurrence of I. glandulifera and Fallopia spp.; but not for H. mantegazzianum and Solidago spp. A stratified management approach, employing zones delimitation to assess what threat pose IAS to the PA objects of conservation, can be useful to prioritize control measures in IAS local action plans. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Habitat disturbance; Level of invasion; Natura 2000 network; Neophytes; Species distribution","Czech Republic; Heracleum mantegazzianum; Impatiens glandulifera; Polygonum cuspidatum; Solidago; annual plant; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; biological invasion; disturbance; geographical distribution; herb; human activity; introduced species; invasive species; protected area; zoning system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040861038"

Category V now makes up over half the protected area coverage in Europe, for instance. While the earliest category V areas were designated mainly for their landscape and recreational values, they are increasingly expected also to protect biodiversity. Critics have claimed that they fail to conserve enough biodiversity. The current paper addresses this question by reviewing available evidence for the effectiveness of category V in protecting wild biodiversity by drawing on published information and a set of case studies. Research to date focuses more frequently on changes in vegetation cover than on species, and results are limited and contradictory, suggesting variously that category V protected areas are better than, worse than or the same as more strictly protected categories in terms of conserving biodiversity. This may indicate that differences are not dramatic, or that effectiveness depends on many factors. The need for greater research in this area is highlighted. Research gaps include: (i) comparative studies of conservation success inside and outside category V protected areas; (ii) the contribution that small, strictly protected areas make to the conservation success of surrounding, less strictly protected areas-and vice versa; (iii) the effectiveness of different governance approaches in category V; (iv) a clearer understanding of the impacts of zoning in a protected area; and (v) better understanding of how to implement landscape approaches in and around category V protected areas. © 2016 by the authors.","Biodiversity conservation; IUCN category V; Protected landscape","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010313255"

We apply the broad concepts from this debate to the sea and propose it as a framework to informmarine zoning based on three possible management strategies, establishing: no-take marine reserves, regulated fishing zones, and unregulated open-access areas. We develop a general model that maximizes standing fish biomass, given a fixed management budget while maintaining a minimum harvest level. We find that when management budgets are small, sea-sparing is the optimal management strategy because for all parameters tested, reserves are more cost-effective at increasing standing biomass than traditional fisheries management. For larger budgets, the optimal strategy switches to sea-sharing because, at a certain point, further investing to grow the no-take marine reserves reduces catch below the minimum harvest constraint. Our intention is to illustrate how general rules of thumb derived from plausible, single-purpose models can help guide marine protected area policy under our novel sparing and sharing framework. This work is the beginning of a basic theory for optimal zoning allocations and should be considered complementary to the more specific spatial planning literature for marine reserve as nations expand their marine protected area estates. © The Author(s) 2018.","Fisheries management; Marine policy; Marine protected areas; Marine zoning; Open-access fisheries; Sparing vs sharing","agricultural land; biodiversity; fishery management; food production; habitat use; marine park; marine policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063902990"

Rapid and continuous urban expansion, however, may exert negative effects on the performance of practical zoning designs. Various methods have been developed for protected area zoning, but most of them failed to consider the conflicts between urban development (for the benefit of land developers) and ecological protection (local government). Some real-world zoning schemes even have to be modified occasionally after the lengthy negotiations between the government and land developers. Therefore, our study has presented a game theory-based method to deal with this problem. Future urban expansion in the study area will be predicted by a logistic regression cellular automaton, while eco-protected areas will be delimitated using multi-objective optimization algorithm. Then, two types of conflicts between them can be resolved based on game theory, a theory of decision-making. We established a two-person dynamic game for each conflict zone. The ecological compensation mechanism was taken into account by simulating the negotiation processes between the government and land developers. A final zoning scheme can be obtained when the two sides reach agreements. The proposed method is applied to the eco-protected area zoning in Guangzhou, a fast-growing city in China. The experiments indicate that the conflicts between eco-protection and urban development will inevitably arise when using only traditional zoning methods. Based on game theory, our method can effectively resolve those conflicts, and can provide a relatively reasonable zoning scheme. This method is expected to support policy-making in environmental management and urban planning. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cellular automata; Ecological protection; Game theory; Urban expansion; Zoning","Algorithms; China; City Planning; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Game Theory; Humans; Local Government; Negotiating; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; algorithm; cellular automaton; conflict management; conservation management; decision making; design; environmental management; game theory; local government; optimization; protected area; urban development; zonation; case report; China; city planning; compensation; consensus development; decision making; environmental management; game; government; human; logistic regression analysis; theoretical model; algorithm; city planning; ecosystem; environmental protection; interpersonal communication; procedures","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84956661673"

Some of the analyses made to compare the fishing activity and management measures carried out in the North East Atlantic and in the Mediterranean do not take into account some of the differentiating peculiarities of each of these regions. At the same time, they resort to traditional fisheries management measures and do not discuss the role of marine protected areas as a complementary management tool. In this respect, the apparent failure of marine protected areas in the North-East Atlantic compared with the same in the Mediterranean is challenging European fishery scientists. Application of the classical holistic view of ecological succession to the functioning of fishery closures and no-use areas highlights the importance of combining both management regimes to fully satisfy both fishery- and biodiversity-oriented goals. We advocate that an optimal management strategy for designing an MPA to protect biodiversity and sustain fishing yields consists of combining a network of no-use areas (close to their mature state) with fish boxes (buffer zones maintained by fishing disturbance in a relatively early successional stage, where productivity is higher), under a multi-zoning scheme. In this framework, the importance of no-use areas for fisheries is based on several observations: (1) They preserve biological diversity at regional scale, at all levels-specific, habitat/seascape, and also genetic diversity and the structure of populations, allowing natural selection to operate. (2) They permit the natural variability of the system to be differentiated from the effects of regulation and to be integrated in appropriate sampling schemes as controls.

The target states: ‘by 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscape and seascape’. Indonesia has been committed to set aside 20 million hectares of its coastal and marine waters for biodiversity conservation by 2020, en route to achieving the national target of at least 30 million hectares in the future. Here we demonstrate how the development and expansion of marine protected areas (MPAs) at the local level is crucial if the national government is to achieve the target. Using West Nusa Tenggara (WNT) Province as a case study, we describe the current achievements as well as plans for expanding marine conservation areas in the province by 2020. Despite challenges along the way, by 2016 the province managed to set aside 229,555.36 ha for biodiversity conservation thanks to the district governments’ efforts for establishing MPAs in their respective region. This figure covers approximately 7.87% of the province’s marine waters and contributed 1.25% to the national target of marine conservation areas in 2017. Intelligent preparation of the province’s coastal and small islands zoning plan will provide opportunities to allocate around 100,000 ha more to the WNT coastal and marine waters for conservation areas. With this addition, the total area is estimated to reach around 330,000 ha or approximately 10.29% of the province’s marine waters and would contribute 1.50% to the national target of marine conservation areas by 2020. The related challenges and opportunities for reaching this important target in WNT Province are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Biodiversity Conservancy International.","Aichi Target 11; Indonesia; Lombok; Marine protected areas; Sumbawa; West Nusa Tenggara","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046700043"

For the marine tourism industry to maintain or expand current levels of recreational diving practices, ecologically sustainable management of dive sites is required. This study surveyed 400 SCUBA divers engaged in recreational diving in the subtropical reefs off eastern Australia. A combination of in-water observational research was conducted, with post-dive questionnaires. Linear regression techniques were employed to identify the variables that correlate the frequency of diver contacts with reef biota. Of the 17 variables tested, nine were found to significantly influence contact frequency. These were: the number of days since a diver's last dive, location of original certification, awareness and understanding of marine park zoning (3 variables), site selection, use of photographic equipment, total number of dives logged and diving depth. These results show that while a diver's long-term and recent experience can play a role, awareness of marine park regulations and unidentified differences in prior training (related to location) are also important, suggesting that education and training may provide viable alternatives to limiting diver access at sensitive locations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Benthic reef communities; Marine policy; Marine protected area management; SCUBA diver impacts; SCUBA diving tourism","Australia; Conservation; Location; Marine industry; Reefs; Site selection; Surveys; Education and training; Linear regression techniques; Marine policy; Marine protected area; Observational research; SCUBA diver impacts; Scuba diving; Sustainable management; benthos; education; habitat management; marine park; marine policy; reef; scuba diving; sustainable development; tourism; training; Marine education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017283681"

The South American Dry Chaco contains some of the fastest expanding agricultural frontiers worldwide, and includes diverse forms of land management, mainly associated with different land tenure regimes; which in turn are segregated along environmental gradients (mostly rainfall). Yet, how these regimes impact the environment and how trade-offs between production and environmental outcomes varies remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed how biodiversity, biomass stocks, and agricultural production, measured in meat-equivalents, differ among land tenure regimes in the Dry Chaco. We calculated a land-use outcome index (LUO) that combines indices comparing actual vs. potential values of 'preservation of biodiversity' (PI), 'standing biomass' (BI) and 'meat production' (MI). We found land-use outcomes to vary substantially among land-tenure regimes. Protected areas showed a biodiversity index of 0.75, similar to that of large and medium-sized farms (0.72 in both farming systems), and higher than in the other tenure regimes. Biomass index was similar among land tenure regimes, whereas we found the highest median meat production index on indigenous lands (MI = 0.35). Land-use outcomes, however, varied more across different environmental conditions than across land tenure regimes. Our results suggest that in the Argentine Dry Chaco, there is no single land tenure regime that better minimizes the trade-offs between production and environmental outcomes. A useful approach to manage these trade-offs would be to develop geographically explicit guidelines for land-use zoning, identifying the land tenure regimes more appropriate for each zone. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","conservation of biodiversity; farming, forest biomass; indigenous communities; neotropical dry forests; protected areas zoning","Argentina; Chaco [Argentina]; Agricultural products; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Commerce; Conservation; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Forestry; Meats; Zoning; Agricultural expansion; Agricultural productions; Dry forests; Environmental conditions; Environmental gradient; Forest biomass; Indigenous community; Protected areas; agricultural development; agricultural intensification; agricultural production; biodiversity; biomass; carbon sequestration; conservation management; dry forest; environmental conditions; environmental economics; environmental gradient; indigenous population; land tenure; land use; Neotropic Ecozone; protected area; trade-off; zoning system; Land use","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018496247"

There are systematic planning methods available to address these needs, but they often result in large areas identified as priority for strict protection, which might constrain their implementation. Considering multiple zones with different management regimes might provide a more flexible and practical solution to this problem, though this approach remains poorly used in freshwater systems. We evaluate the use of a multizone approach to enhance protection of freshwater biodiversity and ecological processes in a large reserve network, Natura 2000. Location: Iberian Peninsula. Methods: We tested three scenarios of freshwater conservation planning: (1) a protection-only approach based on areas identified using Marxan; (2) a more flexible approach where multiple management zones are considered using Marxan with Zones, both accounting for Natura 2000; and (3) a third one similar to (2) but ignoring Natura 2000. The three scenarios were compared considering their effectiveness in representing all species. We also evaluated the role of Natura 2000 within the management zones identified and the effect of these areas. Results: We found that although there was only an 8% reduction in total area required to complement Natura 2000 under the multizone approach compared to the protection-only approach, the refinement of conservation recommendations under different management zones can reduce the area needed for strict protection by 62%. Considering Natura 2000 compromised the efficiency of solutions while only one-third of its extent was selected under the strict protection zone. Main conclusions: The refinement in management recommendations and resulting improvement in efficiency achieved by using the multizone approach could help unlock the needed expansion of Natura 2000 to adequately cover freshwater conservation needs in the Iberian Peninsula and other areas where similar issues have been highlighted. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","amphibians; freshwater fish; management zones; Marxan with Zones; Natura 2000; reptiles; systematic conservation planning","Iberian Peninsula; Amphibia; Reptilia; amphibian; biodiversity; catchment; conservation planning; conservation status; fish; freshwater environment; nature reserve; reptile; software","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84985972821"

It has been reportedthat the demand for sea use exceeds three-fold the available space in some areas. Thus, many countries have attempted toutilize marine spatial planning or ocean zoning to reduce these conflicts. Marine planning is a strategic guiding program thatefficiently organizes the use of marine space as well as the interactions between usages. This helps in balancing the demandfor marine economic development with the protection of marine ecosystems, and aims to fulfill both social and economicobjectives in an open and planned manner.In China, there has been intense conflicts on issues related to sea use and marinespace, in recent years. With rapid population growth and economic development, various irrational marine developmentactivities have adversely affected the marine environment, threatening both the environment and the future of the activitiesthat depend on it. For example, it has been reported that the ocean and coastal economy was worth over ￥5000 billion in2012, which contributed to 9.6% of China’s total GDP. However, the most recent investigation indicated that the total areacovered by coastal wetlands, mangroves, and reefs have decreased by 57%, 73%, and 80%, respectively, compared withthat recorded in the 1950s. Furthermore, habitat loss and the degradation of ecosystem services also counteract the social-economic-natural ecosystem, which ultimately restricts sustainable societal and economic development. Therefore, there isan increasing urgency to adopt a more integrated approach to plan and manage the marine environment. Legislation, policy,and management tools, or a combination of these, are required in this process. Indeed, a series of marine zoning andplanning schemes, such as Marine Functional Zoning, Sea Use Planning, and the Marine Socioeconomic Development Planhave been implemented by the State Oceanic Administration of China over the past 20-30 years. Marine Functional Zoningis an important scheme that came into effect in 1989. This scheme divides the sea into eight functional zones based ongeographical and ecological features, natural resources, and the need for socioeconomic development. One exclusive, orseveral compatible sea use types, are permitted in any given functional zone. However, these marine plans are primarilybased on social or economic needs (e. g.,ports and fisheries). Moreover, coordination among marine plans remainsinadequate. Marine ecological red line zoning is a new method employed in marine planning and protection, which will beimplemented along the coast of China in the near future. However, systemic methods for marine ecological red line zoningare still lacking, and therefore, require further studies. This article provides a short historical overview and introduction tothe ecological red line concept, proposes a definition and basic principles for establishing marine ecological red lines, anddescribes a possible zoning framework using the Hainan Province as a case study. © 2015, Ecological Society of China.

We explored the respective contributions of environmental factors and human impacts in capturing the distribution of an assemblage of commercially valuable, large-bodied, open-water predators (tunas, marlins and mackerels). Location: Western Australia. Time period: 1997–2006. Major taxa studied: Pelagic fishes. Methods: We compiled 10 years of commercial fishing records from the Sea Around Us Project and derived relative abundance indices from standardized catch rates while accounting for confounding effects of effort, year and gear type. We used these indices to map pelagic hotspots over a 0.5°-resolution grid and built random forests to estimate the importance of 33 geophysical, oceanographic and anthropogenic predictors in explaining their locations. We additionally examined the spatial congruence between these hotspots and an extensive network of marine reserves and determined whether patterns of co-occurrence deviated from random expectations using null model simulations. Results: First, we identified several pelagic hotspots off the coast of Western Australia. Second, geomorphometrics explained up to 50% of the variance in relative abundance of pelagic fishes, and submarine canyon presence ranked as the most influential variable in the North bioregion. Seafloor complexity, geodiversity, salinity, temperature variability, primary production, ocean energy, current regimes and human impacts were also identified as important predictors. Third, spatial overlap between hotspots and marine reserves was limited, with most high-abundance areas primarily found in zones where anthropogenic activities are subject to few regulations. Main conclusions: This study reveals geomorphometrics as valuable indicators of the distribution of mobile fish species and highlights the relevance of harnessing static topography as a key element in any blueprint for ocean zoning and spatial management. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","catch rate standardization; fisheries data; geomorphometrics; hotspot; marine reserves; pelagic fishes; random forest; spatial modelling; submarine canyons; topography","Australia; Western Australia; Makaira; Pisces; Scombridae; abundance; catch statistics; conservation planning; environmental factor; marine park; morphometry; pelagic fishery; spatial analysis; standardization; submarine canyon; topography","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027969678"

We found that, despite the clear-cutting-based forestry system, woodpeckers inhabited commercial seminatural forests in substantial numbers, including the species generally considered vulnerable to timber harvesting. The only negative trend, a drastic decline in the Green Woodpecker, paralleled the loss of seminatural, wooded grasslands and is mostly an issue for landscape planning and agricultural land use. Major silvicultural factors supporting other species in commercial forests include natural regeneration with multiple native tree species and deadwood abundance. In such context, the main role of protected areas is to provide ecological resilience; however, we estimated that the current strict reserves could further double their carrying capacities for woodpeckers through successional recovery and, perhaps, active restoration. The long time series used were instrumental in detecting unexpected dynamics and the impacts of climatically extreme years. We conclude that (1) seminatural forestry can serve as a basis for reconciling timber harvesting and biodiversity protection at the landscape scale, given appropriate attention to key structures and landscape zoning and (2) woodpeckers represent a biological indicator system for the sustainability of forest landscapes in Europe. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Biodiversity; Birds; Landscape zoning; Long-term dynamics; Reserve; Sustainable forest management","Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Europe; Forestry; Forests; Trees; Estonia; Aves; Picidae; Biodiversity; Birds; Conservation; Dynamics; Ecology; Land use; Logging (forestry); Reforestation; Sustainable development; Timber; Zoning; Agricultural land use; Biodiversity protection; Biological indicators; Ecological sustainability; Long term dynamics; Long-term sustainability; Reserve; Sustainable forest management; abundance; agricultural land; biodiversity; bioindicator; dead wood; ecosystem resilience; forest management; land use; landscape planning; long-term change; passerine; protected area; sustainability; timber harvesting; agricultural land; Article; biodiversity; bird; breeding; climate change; environmental sustainability; forest management; forestry; landscape; nonhuman; agriculture; animal; bird; ecology; environmental protection; Europe; forest; tree; Forestry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957942193"

Thus, selection of the best species for cultivation in semiarid and arid climates is fundamental. Salvadora persica is an evergreen perennial halophyte that can grow under extreme conditions, from very dry environments to highly saline soils. Based on international bibliography, the authors outlined an agro-ecological zoning model to determine the potential cultivation zones for S. persica in Argentina. This model may be applied to any part of the world, using the agro-ecological limits presented in this work. All the maps were developed by the implementation of a geographic information system (GIS) that can be updated by the further incorporation of complementary information, with the consequent improvement of the original database. The overlap of the agroclimatic suitability map on the drylands' saline soils and the drylands' alkaline soils maps, determined the agro-ecological zoning. Since some areas in the agro-ecological zoning can overlap with land that is already assigned for other uses, protected areas, current land use/cover of the different zones, and urban areas maps were incorporated into the GIS and subtracted by a mask. This resulted in the delimitation of ""potential cultivation zoning"", thus avoiding possible conflicts surrounding the use of land and making the agro-ecological zonation more efficient. There is a broad agro-ecological zone for cultivation of S. persica that extends from Northern Argentina to approximately 41° South latitude, under dry-subhumid to semiarid climates. Lands classified with different degrees of suitability in the potential cultivation zoning could be used for production of this species for energy purposes on lands that are either unsuitable for food production or currently assigned for other purposes. This paper represents pioneering work since there are no previous studies concerning the introduction of S. persica in Argentina. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Agro-ecological zoning; Agroclimatic zoning; Argentina; Drylands' saline and alkaline soils; Non-traditional oilseed tree; Potential cultivation zoning; Salvadora persica; Subhumid to semiarid climates","Argentina; Biodegradation, Environmental; Desert Climate; Oil and Gas Fields; Salinity; Salvadoraceae; Soil; Argentina; Salvadora persica; Conservation; Ecology; Geographic information systems; Land use; Oils and fats; Soils; soil; Alkaline soils; Argentina; Non-traditional; Salvadora persica; Semi-arid climate; agroecology; crop production; cultivation; dryland farming; GIS; halophyte; saline soil; salinity; zoning system; agroecosystem; Argentina; Article; biofuel production; controlled study; environmental impact; geographic distribution; geographic information system; habitat selection; nonhuman; priority journal; salinity; Salvadora persica; semiarid climate; soil analysis; soil property; species introduction; tillage; urban area; zonation; bioremediation; chemistry; desert climate; oil and gas field; physiology; Salvadoraceae; soil; Zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941142402"

To achieve this, we evaluated the planning of land use around protected areas, as established in the management plans of four protected areas, located in southeastern Brazil, as well as in the master plans of the municipalities covered by these protected areas. We found that these management plans established recommendations rather than specific rules for the use of resources of the buffer zones. Additionally, we verified no uniformity between the master plans on the topic of municipal zoning in the BZs of the PAs studied: only five of the fourteen master plans surveyed delineated a zone around the protected area and defined guidelines for land use consistent with its protection. The results of this study indicate that the use of the buffer zone as an effective strategy for the management of protected areas requires a link between the PA managers and the local government responsible for land use planning, in order to facilitate the articulation between the management plan of the PA and the municipal master plan. Otherwise, the establishment of the buffer zone risks being only a symbolic action, with no practical effect on biodiversity conservation within the protected area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Buffer zone; Management plan; Protected areas","Atlantic Forest; Brazil; action plan; biodiversity; buffer zone; environmental management; environmental planning; guideline; land use planning; local government; national park; occupation; protected area","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039432617"

Typically, representing and replicating the habitat types present within protected areas is used to spread the risk of protecting frequently disturbed sites. This was the approach used during the 2004 re-zoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) via the Representative Areas Program. Over 10 years later, we examine whether the risk was spread by mapping exposure of coral reefs in the GBRMP to four disturbances that cause coral mortality: bleaching, tropical cyclones, crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and freshwater inundation. Our objectives were to: (1) assess whether no-take areas include a range of disturbance regimes, and (2) identify coral reef areas with lower relative exposure. At least 13% and an average of 31% of reef locations in each of 11 exposure classes are included within no-take areas. A greater proportion of low-exposure areas are within no-take areas than high-exposure areas (34.2% vs. 28.3%). The results demonstrate the value of risk spreading when exposure data are not available while also showing that regularly assessing exposure increases capacity for adaptive, resilience-based reef management.

Zoning, or segregation, of recreation—often by non-motorized and motorized activity—is designed to limit physical interaction while providing recreation opportunities to both groups. This article investigated the effectiveness of zoning to reduce recreation conflict in the Vail Pass Winter Recreation Area in Colorado, USA. Despite a zoning management system, established groomed travel routes were used by both non-motorized recreationists (backcountry skiers, snowboarders, snowshoers) and motorized recreationists (snowmobilers). We hypothesized that persistent recreation conflict reported by non-motorized recreationists was the result of recreation occurring in areas of mixed non-motorized and motorized use, mostly along groomed routes. We performed a geospatial analysis of recreation [from Global Positioning System (GPS) points, n = 1,233,449] in the Vail Pass Winter Recreation Area to identify areas of mixed non-motorized and motorized use. We then surveyed non-motorized recreationists (n = 199) to test whether reported conflict is higher for respondents who traveled in areas of mixed-use, compared with respondents traveling outside areas of mixed-use. Results from the geospatial analysis showed that only 0.7 % of the Vail Pass Winter Recreation Area contained recreation from both groups, however that area contained 14.8 % of all non-motorized recreation and 49.1 % of all motorized recreation. Survey analysis results showed higher interpersonal conflict for all five standard conflict variables among non-motorized respondents who traveled in areas of mixed-use, compared with those traveling outside mixed-use areas.

As a significant policy measure, the segmentation of the delineated watershed areas into several zones is implemented by defining areas closest to the intake and more distant areas. Article 8 of the Directive 80/778 relating to the quality of water intended for human consumption in the European Union for example, forces Member States to take measures for securing the quality of water while in some connected policy documents the rationale behind constructing safeguard zones with land-use restrictions are referred to this end. Due to the requirements set out in legislations, authorities responsible for protecting the water quality similarly apply some restrictions on collective settlements, industrial and agricultural developments particularly in the protection zones. Such restrictions have direct impacts on the social and economical activities of the population residing in the basin. Besides, descriptive differences between legislations from different levels or different practices performed by the different authorities lead to disparities between the basins that are subject to quite different protective measures and zoning systems in spite of their analogous basin characteristics. All such challenges and disputes in protection mostly relate to the lack of scientific basis of protection regulations that limits its qualification for being widely acceptable by and easily verifiable to the general public.

The management of fisheries in KNP uses the zoning system and regulation of fishing gear. This article was written to explain the effectiveness of the zoning system in the management of reef fisheries. The study was conducted in KNP in Jepara Regency, Central Java Province between April and September 2015. The data were collected using the survey method, including both primary and secondary data. The respondents were reef fishers who live in Karimunjawa and Kemujan villages, chosen randomly and numbered 94 people. Secondary data were obtained from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and KNP Authority. The data analysis was done descriptively. The effectiveness of the zoning system was measured from the fishers perception of the zoning, their compliance level, and the number of zoning law violations. The results of this study indicated that most of the fishers (65.95%) state that zone markers are not clearly visible, making it difficult for them to differentiate it. A percentage of 52.13% and 65.96% of the fishers did not reprimand and did not report other fishers who caught fish in the core and protection zones to the KNPA. The fishers compliance level in average was 78.56%. The trend of cases concerning zoning and fishing gear infringements rose linearly between 2002 and 2014. There needs to be more intensive efforts to educate the public about the core and protection zones to build the fishers awareness. © 2016, BIOFLUX SRL.

A handful of ‘parks’ were established between the 1870s and 1940s and, following World War II, increased awareness of threats to the ocean led to global programmes that started in the 1970–1980s. Initially IUCN became the leader, piloting a science-based ‘critical marine habitats’ approach, by which MPAs were aimed at conserving the healthiest and most diverse ecosystems, endangered and charismatic species, and high-profile habitats. During the 1970s, with the support of WWF, UNESCO, UNEP, and growing national efforts, the MPA concept evolved to include biosphere reserves, marine reserves and sanctuaries, large ocean reserves, and other designations that aimed to reconcile long-term protection with human use. From the 1980s, MPAs greatly expanded in number and scope. By the turn of the millennium, MPAs were proliferating, and principles and methodologies were available to guide their establishment and management in a harmonized manner. Zoning for different uses was widespread, but questions were being raised about the efficacy of biodiversity conservation in areas where extractive uses were permitted. MPA implementation accelerated once targets were introduced by the Convention on Biological Diversity. Campaigns and fundraising by non-governmental organizations and further national efforts resulted in a rapid increase although, by 2015, less than 4% of ocean surface was protected. Current challenges include: (1) understanding the role of MPAs in maintaining ecosystem services, fishery management, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and other emergent problems; (2) more rigorous network design; (3) effective governance and demonstration of ‘success’; and (4) integrating MPAs with marine spatial planning. While MPAs have provided one of the most viable and politically acceptable approaches to marine conservation for 50 years, their role in developing a fully effective marine ecosystems management regime has yet to be fully explored and understood.

However MPA design based on the results of systematic conservation planning tools alone does not fully represent important information on socioeconomic factors. This is because of the reliance of conservation planning tools on spatial data which is better suited to ecological rather than socioeconomic factors which are predominantly non-spatial. We present a case study from Raja Ampat in Indonesia, to demonstrate how we developed MPA zoning plans for six multiple use MPAs that encompass more than 1 million ha of the world's most diverse coral reef ecosystems. These were developed by combining analysis of ecological and spatial socioeconomic data using decision support tools (Marzone), and incorporation of non-spatial socioeconomic data from experts, stakeholders, and local communities. By explicitly including socioeconomic criteria and data into MPA zoning, the final zoning plans recognize community use and governance of resources, maximize equity and access to traditional fishing grounds, and better support long-term food security and livelihoods of local communities. These plans also met recommended guidelines for resilient MPA design and were supported by the community and MPA managers (i.e. Raja Ampat Regency and Indonesian National Government).

This study aims to analyze the perceptions and socioeconomic characteristics of divers and artisanal fishers of an offshore MPA, located in Brazilian waters. Data on the perceptions, conflicts, and management of the MPA were gathered through questionnaires and interviews with local actors. The results show that scuba divers and fishers consider the MPA to be very important for biodiversity. They also consider their collaboration in participative management to be of considerable importance, even though they do not form part of the administration. For local actors, the area helps foster the preservation of the marine environment and benefits recreational diving, tourism, and artisanal fishery in local communities. Divers and fishers use the resources and space of the offshore area differently, which results in diverging perceptions and conflicts. Divers propose restricted protection (No-Take Zones), while fishers propose that the MPA should be used exclusively by the poor local communities for artisanal fishing. Conflicts arising from inefficient public administration (lack of environmental zoning, management plans, and participative management) and illegal use of the MPA were also identified.

However, such knowledge is not always available, sufficient, or even identifiable. The seabob-shrimp small-scale fisheries in the shallow waters of the State of São Paulo, in Southeastern Brazil, plays an important role in coastal livelihoods, providing social and economic benefits for a number of local communities and a premium source of regional seafood. Around 4000 fish-workers produce supplies for restaurants, fishmongers and supermarkets in coastal towns with about 2 million inhabitants. Nevertheless, harbor and naval mooring, the construction of pipelines, sewage disposal, controversial seasonal closures, and marine spatial zoning have all restricted the activity. A territorial approach is here proposed to examine the timeline of vertically implemented laws/regulations that may have resulted in a decrease of territories formerly available to that fisheries, accompanied by a comprehensive outlook of the overall policy context. The shrinkage of fishing territories has been evidenced and the kind of territorial loss detected does not seem to be implicit in cost analysis of fisheries, ecosystem services, or compensation. Top-down policies and a misunderstanding of environmental mitigation programs appear to have been contributing to increasing conflicts, mining multi-stakeholder processes and social justice in contrast to the ascendant economic growth of both the oil and gas and port industries. While economic and political pressures seem to shape current fishing territories, the recognition of the diversity of interests and power asymmetries in coastal zones directs our attention to a vital, often ignored, dimension of social reality. Institutional challenges and recommendations, such as territorial use rights and legal innovations are discussed, adding value to the self-organization of local communities for an effective process of balanced power both within and outside legal marine protected areas. © 2016, Gasalla.","Coastal stewardship; Compensation; Dredging; Environmental policies; Fishers; Marine protected areas; Oil and gas; Territorial approach","Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Decapoda (Crustacea); Xiphopenaeus kroyeri; coastal zone; coastal zone management; compensation system; cost analysis; environmental policy; fishery economics; fishery regulation; fishing community; food market; gas industry; marine park; oil industry; seafood; shrimp fishery; social justice; stakeholder; sustainable development; territory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979971009"

In this way, it was possible to compare projected zoning changes on land use/landcover, as well as implications for wetlands. The methodology involved the reconstruction of scenarios based on norms and evaluation of thematic maps generated from remote sensing products. Digital Image Processing techniques were used to map land use/land cover categories and to identify the boundaries of protected areas in each period. The largest change observed indicates loss of 1,907.09 ha of flooded areas of the fluvial-marine plain, almost totally occupied by salt evaporation tanks. In 1965, three categories of PPA were observed, accounting for 455.17 ha, but for law limitations only 83.45 ha were protected. In relation to 2012, six categories of PPA were detected, totaling 1,051.96 ha, as a consequence of the expansion of protective areas, but the previously consolidated areas reduced to 787.57 ha the size of protected areas in the last period. The brazilian estuarine environment is remarked by the lack of more specific legislation that best protects wetlands. Permanent Preservation Areas are unsufficient to guarantee environmental quality of the coastal region, especially in study area, where there´s flood risks and degraded ecosystems. © 2018, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

The estuary is also part of the Rio Pacoti Environmental Protection Area (Rio Pacoti EPA), which is important for the stability of the local ecosystems and the exchange of material and energy. Despite being protected legally, the environmental quality of the study area is being threatened by impacts such as the deforestation, landfills, the contamination of the water table, and unregulated building, which all alter the natural dynamics of the local systems. These impacts result from inadequate processes of land use and occupation, which fail to respect local potentialities and limitations. The present study found that these processes of degradation are ongoing, and do not only contradict the legislation that regulates the sustainable use of the local environment, but may also cause irreparable damage to the local geo-ecological systems, constituting a grave problem for this sector of the coast of Ceará. In this context, the study presents a geo-environmental description of the estuary and an integrated diagnosis, based on the geoecological analysis of the landscape, in two phases -organization and survey, analysis, diagnosis, and proposals. The application of this geo-ecological analysis resulted in the demarcation and classification of the following units: coastal plain and the pre-coastal plateau.

Ecological suitability assessment is the key to realizing sustainability and is also significant for optimizing spatial patterns of territorial development. Especially in mountainous areas where the ecosystem is both vulnerable and important, quantitative evaluation of ecological suitability for land development is particularly important and urgent given current development strategy of urban construction in mountainous areas in China. Taking Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, a representative urban construction zone in a mountainous area in Yunnan Province, China, as a study area, and based on the fundamental theory of structural and functional dynamics from landscape ecology, this study has explored the integrated ecological resistance (IER) conceptual model and constructed an index system with aspects of ecological elements, ecological importance, and ecological resilience. The results showed that: (1) the ecological suitability level was higher in the north than in the south and higher in the east than in the west, as well as higher in the Bazi region than in mountainous areas. Dali City, Binchuan County, and Xiangyun County had large ecological suitable zones for development and construction. Foci of ecological resistance having strong ecological constraints were mainly concentrated in Heqing County and in various other places; (2) by combining the integrated ecological resistance and arable land distributions, the study area was zoned into five regions: prior development zone, moderate development zone, potential development zone, restricted development zone, and forbidden development zone. Moderate, potential, and restricted development zones occupied most of the area, accounting for 28.89%, 24.69%, and 21.40%, respectively, whereas prior development zones accounted for only 8.91%; (3) based on the areal proportions of ecological suitability zoning, the 12 counties of Dali Prefecture can be grouped into three categories: prior areas for conservation, comprehensive development areas, and prior areas for development. Xiangyun County and Binchuan County should be regarded as key areas of Dali Prefecture for urban construction in mountainous areas.

Hence, between the species richness of phytocoenoses and relative density of individuals of dominant species (RDD), negative dependence should be observed. However, according to another view, the number of species and structure of their abundance are determined by the different processes. The number of species is determined by the species pool size and the rate of species immigration, while the abundance structure - by the competition (Stirling, Wilsey, 2001; Ma, 2005; Wilsey, Stirling, 2007). In particular, in some communities a decrease of RDD leads to an increase in abundance of subdominant species and to oligodominant structure. These changes in relative abundance could occur without changes in species richness. Therefore these variables could be weakly related (Ma, 2005; Wilsey, Stirling, 2007; Munson, Lauenroth, 2009). However, it is unclear how widely these scenarios are realized in the plant cover. The aim of our study was to examine the relationship between RDD, the dominance structure as a whole (mono- or oligodominant), the species richness and the size of the species pool in the forest stands of the Western Caucasus. The data of forest stands were collected in the river basins of the Malaya Laba, Belaya, Sukko, Pshada, Vulan, Nebug, Agoy, Shepsi, Nauzhi, Shakhe, Sochi, Khosta, Mzymta, and some others (altitude: 10-2100 m a. s. l.). In accordance with the scheme of landscape-floristic zoning of the Western Caucasus (Zernov, 2006), the studied stands are located in Novorossiysk, Sochi and Maykop regions (Fig. 1). A significant amount of data was collected in protected areas (Caucasus Biosphere Reserve, Sochi National Park, Bolshoy Tkhach Nature Park, Maykop Botanical Reserve, and others). The sample plots (300 m2) were set in all the most widespread forest communities (altogether 685). All trees > 6.0 cm dbh were counted in each sample plot. The data were analyzed as follows: 1. types of stands were allocated according to dominant, subdominant and constant species; 2. for each plot the total number of individuals per 300 m2 (W), dominance level (RDD = W1/W where W1 - individual number of species of first rank), and number of species per plot (S) were calculated; the total number of species (N), that is the size of regional species pool (Zobel et al., 1998) was determined for each type of stands; 3. average density and constancy of species, as well as N and average S, in stands of each type with high and low RDD as well as these in the mono- and oligodominant stands were compared. Also, the relationship between species richness (S) and RDD for each community type were considered. Based on the dominant and constant species the forest stands were merged into 12 types: BL - stands dominated by Betula litwinowii (1850- 2200 m a. s. l.); ANU, ANM and ANL - Abies nordmanniana (1500-2000, 1000-1500 and 600-1000 m, respectively); FON and FOS - Fagus orientalis (on the northern (with absence of Castanea sativa, Maykop region, 400-600 m) and southern (with presence of Castanea sativa, Sochi region, 80-1000 m) macroslopes of Big Caucasian Ridge); AG and AI - Alnus glutinosa and A. incana (floodplains, 100- 800 m); QR - Quercus robur (200-350 m); PN - Pinus nigra subsp. pallasiana (30-200 m); QPS and QPN - stands with dominated by Quercus petraea and the presence (Novorossiysk region, 50-500 m) or absence (Maykop and Sochi regions, 350-1000 m) of Carpinus orientalis (Tabl. 1 and 2; Fig. 2-8). All stands with high RDD (0.68-0.92) are monodominant (Tabl. 1, Fig. 9A). The mean species diversity of stands of specific types (S) varies from 1.8 to 3.7 species per 300 m2 (Tabl. 3; Fig. 9b). The lowest species richness (1.8 species) was found in the upper-mountain fir stands (ANU) and in the low-mountain beech stands (FON); the highest - in ANL, FOS and QR (3.1-3.7 species). The stands with low RDD (0.34-0.54) in relatively severe environments are monodominant (BL, QPN and PN); in relatively favorable ones - mainly oligodominant (Tabl. 1). In forest stands with a low RDD most of species have a higher constancy than in stands with a high RDD (Tabl. 2). Therefore, the first ones are characterized mainly by higher species richness (2.6-4.8 species per 300 m2) (Tabl. 3; Fig. 9b). On average, for types of stands where the oligodominant structure is not common, it is 70 % higher. In types of communities, where such a structure is formed relatively often, on average by 29 %. Hence, there is a negative correlation between RDD and S in stands of all types (Tabl. 4). However, the Pearson' correlation coefficient in the monodominant stands in harsh habitats (BL, QPN and PN) is higher than in mono- and oligodominant stands in more favorable habitats. The total number of species recorded in stands with high and low RDD, as well as with mono- and oligominant structure is (with some exceptions) similar: 5-14 species (Tabl. 3; Fig. 9B). The smallest number of species (5-6) is in the upper-mountain birch (BL) and fir (ANU) stands; average (8-9) - in the fir stands of the upper part of the middle-mountain belt (ANM), as well as in stands on the dry slopes of the Black Sea coast (PN); the largest (10-14) - in stands of moderately warm and humid habitats (ANL, FON, FOS, QR, and others). The situation when the species community richness with high and low RDD is different, while the size of the species pool is similar, may indicate a relative independence of these parameters (Fig. 10). Thus, the species richness of forest stands of the Western Caucasus on small plots closer linked with structures of dominance, than with species pool size.

Using the Marxan decision support tool we conducted a systematic planning process to identify High Conservation Value Areas in the channels and fjords of the southern Chile ecoregion. We involved 74 experts and other stakeholders in identifying conservation features, setting targets and compiling distribution data. Current distributions of 39 features were used in Marxan analyses. In one scenario we locked planning units that contained the Francisco Coloane Marine Protected Area. In a second scenario we also excluded planning units that overlapped with Appropriate Areas for Aquaculture, defined by the Chilean government's coastal zoning process. One-hundred percent of the proposed conservation targets were met in both scenarios. Although the distribution of 12 conservation features overlapped to a certain extent (>10%) with Appropriate Areas for Aquaculture, Marxan identified conservation solutions avoiding these areas.

To assess decadal changes in rocky reef fish assemblages following MPA protection, fish assemblages were monitored regularly in the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park (PSGLMP), New South Wales, Australia, using Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUVs) comparing between fished and non-fished zones. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of fish assemblages and fishery targeted species were assessed from 2006–2016 at two no-take zones at Broughton and Fingal Islands, and compared with nearby fished areas. A total of 102 species from families was observed over the study, with fish assemblage response being dependent on both the spatial scales of MPA zoning and locations within the park, and the temporal scales assessed. Five fishery targeted families, Labridae, Scorpaenidae, Sparidae, Monacanthidae and Cheilodactylidae, increased in relative abundance within no-take zones, compared with fished zones, although the response was variable among families and between locations. While abundance increased at both locations following the implementation of no-take zones, a significant zoning effect was only detected at Broughton Island, with the Labridae and Sparidae displaying the greatest increases in relative abundance within the no-take zone. This study demonstrates that the response of fish assemblages and targeted fishery families to the implementation of no-take MPA zones varies both temporally, and between locations. Differences in the assemblage response between locations are likely driven by the size and habitats within the no-take zones and these factors need to be adequately considered in MPA planning. © 2017","BRUV; Fishery targeted families; Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park; Spatial scale","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032894782"

Understanding attitudes towards newly created Marine Parks among user groups provides valuable information for the design of education and engagement programs, while also creating a benchmark to compare changes over time. A survey of community perceptions and awareness regarding the recently created Ngari Capes Marine Park in south-west Western Australia was measured via a randomised telephone survey of local and non-local boat-based recreational fishers; and local residents (including non-fishers and shore/boat fishers). This survey also evaluated other recreational uses of the park and how these activities were valued, knowledge of Marine Park zones, and how information about Marine Parks was being accessed. Participation in recreational fishing within Ngari Capes was above average and a supportive attitude towards the park was apparent. Boat-based recreational fishers displayed a higher degree of concern about fishing restrictions compared to local residents, but overall were supportive of the Marine Park.

These had fuelled proximate threats including bush fires, logging and poaching. The study revealed also that the recent re-zoning of the reserve by extending its boundaries to enhance its ecological viability has not only strained the relationship between local people and Officials of the Wildlife Division, but become the root cause of most of the underlying threats. Considering the pressure and threats of Kogyae, the study proposes two options for resolving the situation: granting the communities’ request to engage in ecologically friendly activities in the ‘Special Use Zone’ by re-categorizing the zone appropriately according to IUCN definition, or resettlement of the communities elsewhere to free the reserve from human activities. © 2015, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

Although management systems (i.e. Go Slow Zones) are in place in some areas to minimise vessel-turtle collisions, incidents may persist when the spatial extent of the protection and habitat use by animals do not match or when turtle populations increase. In Queensland, Australia, most incidents are recorded in the Moreton Bay region despite enforcement of the Go Slow Zones in some of the bay's shallow water zones (water depth ≤ 5 m). Our study investigated the degree to which the current Go Slow Zones provide protection to sea turtles in Moreton Bay, and the potential for improvement of current management initiatives. We tracked 18 green (Chelonia mydas) and 20 loggerhead (Caretta caretta) turtles using Argos-linked Fastloc GPS tags for periods between 22 and 999 d, and examined how they used habitat in relation to the Go Slow Zones and water depth. We found that the highest protection was provided to green turtles (39%) and loggerhead turtles (55%) residing in the eastern side of Moreton Bay, where most of the current Go Slow Zones are located. However, we also found that the current Go Slow Zones offer little or no protection to turtles using southern, western and northern Moreton Bay, or any deeper water zones (water depth > 5 m). Given the frequent use of the shallow areas by our study turtles, if all shallow zones in Moreton Bay were to be designated as Go Slow Zones, nearly a half or more of their habitats could be protected from vessel operation. Additionally shallow zones plus a 1.2 km, 2.4 km, or 3.6 km buffer could protect ≥80%, ≥90% or ≥95% of their habitats as the extra areas cover the deeper zones adjacent to the shallow zones. Our findings are highly informative to conservation managers when revising or developing Go Slow Zones in Moreton Bay, with potential application to the management of other coastal areas used by sea turtles globally. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Go Slow Zones; Marine Protected Areas; Moreton Bay; Satellite telemetry; Sea turtles; Vessel collision","Australia; Moreton Bay; Queensland; Animalia; Caretta caretta; Chelonia mydas; Cheloniidae; Testudines; Conservation; Ecosystems; Caretta caretta; Loggerhead turtles; Management systems; Marine protected area; Moreton Bay; Sea turtles; Vessel collision; Vessel operations; biotelemetry; coastal water; coastal zone management; collision; conservation management; GPS; marine park; shallow water; turtle; Coastal zones","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016974316"

However, faced with other pressing issues, ocean management reform has not yet received significant traction from the government, a pattern seen in many locations. Spatial planning processes often struggle during the proposal, planning, or implementation phases due to stakeholder opposition and/or government wariness to change. Conflict among stakeholders about management reform has also proven to be a deterrent to MSP application in many locations. With these obstacles in mind, a detailed stakeholder survey was conducted in Bermuda to determine awareness, attitudes and perceptions regarding ocean health, threats to ocean environments, the effectiveness of current ocean management, and possible future changes to management. How perceptions vary for different types of stakeholders and how attitudes about specific concerns relate to attitudes about management changes were examined. Overall, the results indicate a high degree of support for spatial planning and ocean zoning and a high level of concordance even among stakeholder groups that are typically assumed to have conflicting agendas. However, attitudes were not entirely homogeneous, particularly when delving into details about specific management changes. For example, commercial fishers were generally less in favor, relative to other stakeholder groups, of increasing regulations on ocean uses with the notable exception of regulations for recreational fishing. Given the results of this survey, public support is likely to be high for government action focused on ocean management reform in Bermuda. © 2017","Bermuda; Marine protected areas; Marine spatial planning; Natural resource management; Ocean zoning; Stakeholder survey","Bermuda; attitudinal survey; future prospect; marine environment; marine park; perception; resource management; spatial planning; stakeholder; zoning system","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026879519"

These three years have been chosen based on the time when spatial planning law was introduced and different local zoning plans for Warsaw were passed, including preserved areas for the ventilation corridors. The roughness parameters mapping focuses mainly on frontal area index calculation and itis based on the building database partially derived from satellite imagery (SPOT). Comparison of the derived corridors with the officially planned preservation areas suggests inaccuracies in their extent, identifies obstacles that occurred over almost twenty years and calls for an evaluation. The proposed analysis might be used by local authorities to revise the shape of existing corridors and to recognise problematic areas, which could lead to better spatial management. © 2017 IEEE.","","Conservation; Mapping; Satellite imagery; Ventilation; Local authorities; Protected areas; Remotely sensed data; Roughness parameters; Spatial management; Spatial planning; Urban environments; Urban ventilation; Remote sensing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020230810"

The overlapping objectives and activities have caused severe conflicts among users and with the natural marine environment itself. For that reason, holistic strategies such as Ecosystem Based Management (EBM) and Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) have been evolved and developed to sustainably manage the marine environment, avoiding conflicts and creating synergies. Spatial analysis tools like Marxan have been used for several years as decision support tools mostly for conservation plans, such as design and establishment of protected areas. In this study we approach the potential of this tool with a different purpose in mind: instead of using the available information of the region for the development of a conservation plan, we used this tool and the available information to select areas to establish Aquaculture Management Areas (AMAs). We also intended to analyse how the existing features of the region would affect the final result of a spatial plan aimed to establish areas for economic and development purposes. We conclude that the use of Marxan can be advantageous to support the planning and development of coastal regions, not only in a conservationist point of view (as it has been mostly used), but also into a developing and economic driven approach. This tool can be particularly useful in regions or situations where there is a large number of stakeholders, ecological and geographical features that could potentially conflict with the establishment, the management and the success of the proposed management areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aquaculture Management Areas; Decision support tools; Maritime Spatial Planning; Marxan; Spatial analysis","Aquaculture; Conservation; Decision support systems; Ecology; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Geographical regions; Spatial variables measurement; Aquaculture management; Decision support tools; Marxan; Spatial analysis; Spatial planning; aquaculture system; decision support system; design; economic development; human activity; marine environment; spatial analysis; zoning; Economic and social effects","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015406139"

Each of the basins accommodates the entire range of processes of groundwater formation: Recharge, flow, internal distribution and discharge. The main reserves of fresh groundwater occur close by friable fragmental alluvial proluvial deposits of the Quaternary age. The noteworthy area is the area of intensive loss of river flow to recharge groundwater, making up 50-75 % of the total river flow running from foothills to depressions, where the reserves of groundwater used for drinking water supply occur. Underground water distributed ubiquitously within intermountain basins is characterized by high quality. The deposits of fresh groundwater are used for drinking, household, industrial and technical (irrigation) purposes. In accordance with the performed zoning with respect to the degree of groundwater pollution protection, a considerable part of groundwater territories is poorly protected. To preserve groundwater, it is required to optimize and extend the existing water monitoring networks, as well as to create protected areas of promising deposits, with the limited placement of industries and a regime of groundwater protection against pollution and depletion.","Depletion; Deposits; Exploitation; Groundwater; Infiltration; Intermountain basins; Monitoring; Sources of pollution; Underground water protection","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982157013"

The native vegetation cover under the PCBR protection decreased by 65% over 24 years; whereas agriculture and livestock lands doubled, even within the core conservation areas of the PCBR.

We examined case studies of such resistance in Victoria, Australia, Bavaria, Germany, and Florida, United States. We considered 4 ways to tackle this problem. First, broaden the case for protected areas beyond nature conservation to include economic, human health, and other benefits, and translate these into a persuasive business case for protected areas. Second, better communicate the conservation values of protected areas. This should include highlighting how many species, communities, and ecosystems have been conserved by protected areas and the counterfactual (i.e., what would have been lost without protected area establishment). Third, consider zoning of activities to ensure the maintenance of effective management. Finally, remind citizens to think about conservation when they vote, including holding politicians accountable for their environmental promises.

Assessment of MPAs effectiveness requires synchronous sampling of protected and non-protected areas at multiple spatial and temporal scales. We used an autonomous underwater vehicle to map benthic communities in replicate 'no-take' and 'general-use' (fishing allowed) zones within three MPAs along 7o of latitude. We recorded 92 taxa and 38 morpho-groups across three large MPAs. We found that important habitat-forming biota (e.g. massive sponges) were more prevalent and abundant in no-take zones, while short ephemeral algae were more abundant in general-use zones, suggesting potential short-term effects of zoning (5±10 years). Yet, short-term effects of zoning were not detected at the community level (community structure or composition), while community structure varied significantly among MPAs. We conclude that by allowing rapid, simultaneous assessments at multiple spatial scales, autonomous underwater vehicles are useful to document changes in marine communities and identify adequate scales to manage them. This study advanced knowledge of marine benthic communities and their conservation in three ways. First, we quantified benthic biodiversity and abundance, generating the first baseline of these benthic communities against which the effectiveness of three large MPAs can be assessed. Second, we identified the taxonomic resolution necessary to assess both short and long-term effects of MPAs, concluding that coarse taxonomic resolution is sufficient given that analyses of community structure at different taxonomic levels were generally consistent. Yet, observed differences were taxa-specific and may have not been evident using our broader taxonomic classifications, a classification of mid to high taxonomic resolution may be necessary to determine zoning effects on key taxa. Third, we provide an example of statistical analyses and sampling design that once temporal sampling is incorporated will be useful to detect changes of marine benthic communities across multiple spatial and temporal scales. © 2018 Ferrari et al.

Various countries have introduced legal mechanisms to create and manage their important ecosystems, such as mangroves. Despite the significance of evaluating the effectiveness of PAs, literature on the topic is scarce, especially pertaining to the mangrove ecosystems. Therefore, the present study intended to evaluate the management of a PA located in northeastern Brazil throughout the first decade of the current century (2003, 2006, and 2012). The management of the PA was considered inadequate, and the level of efficacy even declined progressively, although a slight improvement was recorded in 2006. The respective levels of effectiveness were 35%, 50%, and 15% for 2003, 2006, and 2012. The improvement recorded in 2006 was attributed to a new management plan and the ensuing environmental actions, such as monitoring and management programs, PA zoning, and others. The worst management performance was indicated for the following assessment parameters, namely, administrative matters (public administration), biogeographic characteristics, and threats. One of the main reasons for the low management effectiveness is that the mangrove PA is located in an urban area of one the most densely populated cities in Brazil, namely, Fortaleza, (7786 inhabitant/km2). The location has led to an increase in the number of threats to the PA and has strongly influenced the biogeographic characteristics. The urbanization in and around the area has resulted in the PA being isolated, with no connection to other ecosystems through ecological corridors. Both direct measures and strategic planning are required to facilitate continuous improvement of the management effectiveness of PAs. This strategy is imperative in countries with tropical ecosystems characterized by significant biodiversity, which is vulnerable to anthropogenic effects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental management; Marine protected areas; Tropical ecosystems","Brazil; Ceara; Fortaleza; Rhizophoraceae; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Public administration; Urban planning; Anthropogenic effects; Continuous improvements; Environmental action; Management effectiveness; Marine protected area; Monitoring and management; Northeastern Brazil; Tropical ecosystems; anthropogenic effect; biogeography; conservation management; conservation planning; environmental management; environmental monitoring; management practice; mangrove; marine park; tropical environment; urban area; urbanization; Environmental management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961583675"

In particular, protected area planning should satisfy the demand for multiple land uses, while offering optimal protection of our natural resources. The present research aims at providing park's managers, as well as other stakeholders and decision makers, with a scientifically sound and practical approach to zoning protection levels and supporting the strategic planning phase in nature conservation. This paper thus proposes and tests the development of an indicators-based spatial Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis for a complex territorial system with exceptional multiple values. As a result, key conservation priorities and warning spots are identified to support the subsequent decision-making phase. The innovative value of the research stems not only from the integrated methodological approach based on the combination between spatial analysis, indicators systems and the traditional SWOT analysis, but also from the contextual characteristics and physical extension of the area under investigation. Moreover, the integrated and innovative framework proposed in the paper has also international significance, thanks to the possibility of replicating the research strategy and methodological approach in other contexts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to protect biodiversity rescources, many countries have established numerous nature reserves and other types of protected areas. However, degradation of natural resources is a big challenge in conservation projects, and we cannot prohibit all the activities associated with economic development in the conserved areas, particularly in southwest China. There is a serious conflict between two aspects. One aspect is the rich biodiversity, increasing its importance for conservation. The other is the backward economy that requires more resources for local development. Therefore, land zoning is an important approach that can reduce conflict by partitioning the landscape into various land use units that are managed according to different levels of human activity. Our research focuses on the Three Parallel Rivers of the Yunnan Protected Area. We present a systematic methodology that integrates vegetation plot data with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique to guide a zoning scheme. The vegetation plot data include species richness, rarity of vegetation, number of endangered plant species, ranking of endangered species, and quality of habitat. Based on these data, the protection value scores for the sub-vegetation in northwest Yunnan were obtained. Then altitude, distance to villages, distance to roads and distance to rivers were used as the impact factors to simulate the pattern of protection cost. The protection value and protection cost were integrated to generate a final combined suitability map. A K-means cluster analysis was performed to classify the suitability map into four priority levels. In this study, the area considered under level 1 was 16983 km2, accounting for 25.58% of the total research area. The targeted areas for protection in level 1 included sub-vegetation of monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest, cold-temperate coniferous forest, alpine and sub-alpine meadow, cold-temperate shrub, and areas covered by snow and water; level 1 accounts for the most important protection areas where important forest ecosystems, grassland ecosystems, and wetland ecosystems can be found. The areas under level 1 can be further divided into six parts. Part 1 is located northeast of Zhongdian; the average altitude is above 3000 m, and it is covered by cold-temperate coniferous forest. Part 2 comprises most areas of Denqing and northern Weixi, which include the Meili and Baima snowmountains. Part 3 forms the main part of the Nu mountains in Yunnan, and it appears as a line. Part 4 is located in Gongshan and Fugong, including the main part of Gaoligong National Nature Reserve. Part 5 comprises regions of southeast Zhongdian, northwest Ninglang, and northeast Lijiang. Although this part has a large area, its distribution is scattered. Part 6 comprises the Erhai Lake in Dali, which has a small area, and it is the only critical conservation region southeast of our research area. Level 2 accounts for the main areas for the conservation of forest ecosystems. Therefore, we suggested that an equal protection effort as level 1 should be made. Level 3 had a low protection value and we could use it as a buffer zone. Level 4 had no protection value and was considered the traditional land use area. According to the priority levels, we determined the area under level 1 as the priority area. We believe that our results will be useful as a reference for extension of reserves in northwest Yunnan in the future. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

Recreation brings important benefits to human well-being, and allowing people to experience nature in protected areas can also provide revenue and support for conservation objectives. However, not all recreational activities are compatible with environmental management goals. Here, we show how a coastal protected area can be zoned to satisfy both recreational and conservation objectives. We collected empirical data on the effect of recreational disturbance to foraging shorebirds in Moreton Bay Marine Park, Queensland, Australia, and calculated the benefit of alternative protected area zone types on shorebird representation using a zero-inflated negative binomial model. The predictions from this model were used to optimize a zoning plan in a linear programming framework that balances recreational use with shorebird conservation. Costs reflect foregone recreational opportunity, thereby facilitating solutions that minimize restrictions on recreational use of the coastline. We discover a consistent negative effect of recreational use of the foreshore on shorebird occupancy and abundance and show that, despite this, zoning can be used to achieve shorebird representation targets with only a small cost to recreational opportunity. When dog recreation is permitted at all sites, a 91% shorebird representation target can be met, indicating that de facto patterns of recreation were rather well segregated from areas used by shorebirds. By restricting dog recreation to five sites and allowing people to access all other foreshore sites, shorebird representation increased to 97%. Synthesis and applications. Our approach of calculating the contribution of each zone type towards conservation objectives results in zoning plans with robust estimates of conservation benefit that can be readily implemented by managers. Specifically, we estimated the effects of removing people and domestic dog recreation within each intertidal site on shorebird abundance to inform coastal zoning plans. Incorporating cost as foregone recreational opportunity results in zoning plans that minimize the number of people required to make a behavioural change. Compliance to zone types is often ultimately voluntary so integrating the current intensity of recreational use is more likely to generate workable zoning plans. © 2016 The Authors.

The present study focused on two major issues in conservation planning including socioeconomic costs and zoning procedure. The goal was to prioritize and identify representative areas for bird conservation, while minimizing the economic cost for the silvicultural sector and resolve conflicts with recreational activities. The study was conducted in forest areas of Golestan Province as part of Hyrcanian mixed forests, located along the southern coasts of the Caspian Sea and northern slopes of the Alborz Mountains, northern Iran. We used systematic conservation software Marxan with Zones to select candidate areas for conservation. Two types of conservation networks were defined, one with high and partial protection zones and the other with high protection zones only. We focused on four conservation scenarios varying in targets, costs, and multiple zones. The results showed that incorporation of socioeconomic costs significantly decreases the potential impacts on the silvicultural and recreational sectors without significant change in the area of protection zones. Furthermore, we found that design of multiple zone conservation areas facilitates evaluation of a wider range of conservation scenarios that can reduce potential socioeconomic impacts on other interests. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH","Hyrcanian mixed forests; Marxan with zones; MaxEnt; Socioeconomic costs; Systematic conservation planning; Zoning","Golestan; Iran; Aves; bird; conservation planning; mixed forest; protected area; silviculture; socioeconomic impact; species conservation; zoning system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031087507"

The study area was divided into 6 sectors to assess spatial related differences in the assemblage parameters, such as species composition and richness, and the size structure of species of recreational (e.g. SCUBA diving) interest. A total of fifty-eight taxa (56 species and 2 genera) and 20 families of fishes were recorded. Species composition was significantly affected by habitat and depth, whereas no significant changes were detected among sectors. Conversely, species richness and total density of fish showed no significant differences among sectors, habitat types and depth ranges. The majority of species of recreational value was recorded only off the north-western part of the promontory. The implementation of a fishing ban in such an area, characterized by the presence of a rocky bank, would contribute to the recovery of the populations of certain emblematic species (e.g. groupers and other large predators) and to the enhancement of environmentally sustainable activities such as scuba diving. Throughout the investigated area and, especially, along the eastern and south-western coasts of the promontory, several species were almost exclusively represented by small and medium-sized individuals, a likely consequence of intense fishing pressure.","Fish assemblage; Mediterranean Sea; MPA zoning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016121202"

The current IUCN categorisation of MPAs is based on management objectives which many times have a significant mismatch to regulations causing a strong uncertainty when evaluating global MPAs effectiveness. A novel global classification system for MPAs based on regulations of uses as an alternative or complementing the current IUCN system of categories is presented.

Under this system, part of the forest is set aside for protected areas, counterbalanced by intensive and extensive management of the rest of the forest. Studies indicate this may provide adequate timber while minimizing road construction and favoring the development of large mature and old stands. However, it is unclear how the spatial arrangement of intensive management areas may affect the success of this zoning. Should these areas be agglomerated or dispersed throughout the forest landscape? Should managers prioritize (a) proximity to existing roads, (b) distance from protected areas, or (c) site-specific productivity? We use a spatially explicit landscape simulation model to examine the effects of different spatial scenarios on landscape structure, connectivity for native forest wildlife, stand diversity, harvest volume, and road construction: (1) random placement of intensive management areas, and (2–8) all possible combinations of rules (a)–(c). Results favor the agglomeration of intensive management areas. For most wildlife species, connectivity was the highest when intensive management was far from the protected areas. This scenario also resulted in relatively high harvest volumes. Maximizing distance of intensive management areas from protected areas may therefore be the best way to maximize the benefits of intensive management areas while minimizing their potentially negative effects on forest structure and biodiversity. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Coarse filter; Connectivity; Forest conservation; Logging; Plantations; SELES","Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Deer; Forestry; Forests; Models, Theoretical; Mustelidae; Population Dynamics; Sciuridae; Songbirds; Trees; Agglomeration; Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation; Environmental protection; Highway administration; Logging (forestry); Road construction; Roads and streets; Transportation; Zoning; Coarse filter; Connectivity; Forest conservation; Plantations; SELES; biodiversity; connectivity; ecosystem function; ecosystem health; forest management; logging (timber); nature conservation; protected area; road construction; timber industry; Article; environmental protection; forest management; genetic variability; harvest; landscape; plantation; Sciuridae; sensitivity analysis; simulation; songbird; wildlife; animal; biodiversity; deer; environmental protection; forest; forestry; Mustelidae; physiology; population dynamics; procedures; theoretical model; tree; Forestry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945448745"

The management of these landscape units can reduce conflicts caused by human activities. Tandoreh National Park is one of the most biologically diverse, protected areas in Iran. Although the area is generally designed to protect biodiversity, there are many conflicts between biodiversity conservation and human activities. For instance, the area is highly controversial and has been considered as an impediment to local economic development, such as tourism, grazing, road construction, and cultivation. In order to reduce human conflicts with biodiversity conservation in Tandoreh National Park, safe zones need to be established and human activities need to be moved out of the zones. In this study we used a systematic methodology to integrate a participatory process with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using a multi–criteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique to guide a zoning scheme for the Tandoreh National Park, Iran. Our results show that the northern and eastern parts of the Tandoreh National Park that were close to rural areas and farmlands returned less desirability for selection as a preservation area. Rocky Mountains were the most important and most destructed areas and abandoned plains were the least important criteria for preservation in the area. Furthermore, the results reveal that the land properties were considered to be important for protection based on the obtained preservation zone.

As a result, the protected areas of farmland are fragmental in spatial distribution, which increases the difficulty in large-scale production and the risk of occupation by constructive land around. So the capital farmland protection zones need to be transformed from parcels preservation to land use zones in concept; and the zones, which are high-quality and concentrated and have clear outlines and the functions of guiding and separating farmland from constructive and ecological land, can contribute to the capital farmland conservation practice. This paper interprets that land use zone for capital farmland protection has 3 basic rules in zoning. Firstly, the farmland parcels should be almost high-quality with sound drain and irrigation facilities and good capacity to resist the disaster; secondly, zones should have coherence and be closed; and at last, zones should have explicit and unaffected boundary and be encircled by linear features like high-grade road and river, so that they can be convenient for management as the parks. Based on the principles above, this paper proposes the methods consisting of farmland comprehensive quality evaluation, spatial agglomeration of local Moran's I and buffer analysis to delimitate the protected areas of basic farmland, and takes Pinggu District, Beijing City as the case study. At first, it analyzes the comprehensive quality of the capital farmland by multi-factor evaluation and gradual modification method; the factors that are related with the natural quality, location accessibility, development stability and ecological security of the capital farmland are considered in evaluation, and the high-quality capital farmland plot are selected. Then based on the scores of farmland comprehensive quality, spatial agglomeration method of local Moran's I is used to define the spatial pattern of high-quality and low-quality farmland, and the key protection areas of capital farmland are preliminarily delimitated. At last, for the capital farmland protection zones, boundaries modified methods in buffer analysis are used in modification of key areas. Results show that, the average score of the comprehensive quality of the capital farmland in Pinggu district is 53.66, indicating the capital farmland quality is relatively fine. And based on the Moran's I and the local indicators of spatial association method, 4 spatial agglomeration patterns of the fine capital farmland and the other land are obtained, which are high-high, high-low, low-high and low-low pattern, and the high-high and low-high pattern are chosen to the key protection zones that are 11 568.93 hm2. And the final capital farmland protection zones are designed by linear elements such as roads and rivers adjacent to the key protection zones. There are 44 capital farmland protection zones in Pinggu District with the total area of 13 395.99 hm2, covering 80% of the capital farmland plots. The results indicate that the design approach of the capital farmland protection zones based on spatial agglomeration pattern is useful to form the high-quality and concentrated zone with clear outline, which can provide guidelines for the capital farmland protection planning and land use planning in practice. © 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The paper aimed at exploring the permanent protection mechanism of prime farmland in metropolitan suburb combining protection with development, management, and environment improvement. Taking the typical metropolis suburb Changping District as the case study area, this paper firstly specified five objectives of the permanent protection mechanism, namely, the layout centralization, construction reduction, function diversification, management differentiation and capital intensification. With the concentrated prime farmland identification index system built, composed of 11 indicators, this paper analyzed the concentrated degree, the stability and rehabilitation potential. Data mainly comes from the second national land survey data updated to 2013 and land use planning database of Changping District. Meanwhile, alternative concentrated prime farmland areas were filtered and classified, according to the AHP identification results and the classify guideline of ""Function, Spatial, Scale"" principle. Three levels were categorized, the municipal-level, the district-level and the township-level respectively. The three-level concentrated prime farmland special planning is used to clarify the protection responsibility target at all levels and spatial control regulation, determine the evaluation indexes such as quantity, quality and function of prime farmland, and establish the ""economic compensation and index reward"" joint horizontal mechanism and three-level ""rewards and punishments"" joint vertical mechanism. The results indicated that: 13 three-classified prime farmland protection areas were demarcated including one municipal concentrated protection area, six district areas and six township areas, which achieved 96.63% of the prime farmland protection in Changping District. Three-classified farmland protection areas zoning revitalized the stock of construction land effectively, taped the reserve cultivated land resources fully, and increased 1149.97 hm2 cultivated land. The zoning also relieved the landscape and ownership fragmentation, enhanced the management unit scale to 38.76 hm2 and lowered the degree of landscape and ownership fragmentation to 1.21%. In addition, it optimized the farmland landscape pattern, expanded the multiple function of basic farmland utility: after delimiting 6 809.06 hm2 basic production function farmland protection area, it also expanded 1172.88 hm2 landscape function centralized protection area, 1003.03 hm2 ecological function protected area, and 807.03 hm2 blocking function centralized protection area. Moreover, it improved the prime farmland protection enthusiasm of the township and reduced the urban burden of two levels of capital and management pressure.

The mechanism, three-level concentrated prime farmland protection areas zoning and classified regulatory in the metropolitan suburb, can guide the prime farmland concentrating, optimize the layout of prime farmland protection areas, extend the multi-function roles of prime farmland, strengthen the decentralized management of prime farmland, concentrate prime farmland capital allocation, then promote the scale management of prime farmland and improve the quality of the protection. With the farmland landscape pattern optimized and protection fund allocation efficiency and management efficiency improved, the results can help provide reference to decision makers and relevant researches for the national spatial planning of prime farmland protection and targeted policies making. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

It has been developed to apply conservation objectives at different levels of management where conflicting uses can be taking place. GIS is increasingly used to solve land allocation problem with techniques based on zoning, varying from simple overlays to complex multi-criteria evaluation techniques (MCE). This study presents a new approach to the development of zoning plans for Ramsar sites that exhibit major seasonal variations in conservation value and human use and threats. It employs a well-defined GIS-based MCE technique which involves both expert judgment and a set of criteria based on ecological and potential threats. A GIS model using the additive approach in MCE was developed to evaluate Sabkhat Al-Jabboul the only Ramsar site in Syria. The model was applied separately for the spring and winter to accommodate seasonal changes in the intensity and spatial distribution of conservation areas and threats across the site. Separate zoning plans were developed for each of the two main seasons. The zoning plan of the spring season, which is the birds breeding season, included three management zones; the special conservation zone, the conservation buffer zone, and the wise use zone. The winter zoning plan, where the bird feeding activity was the major activity includes two zones: a special conservation zone and a wise use zone. Thus, in cases like Sabkhat Al-Jabboul, where the wetlands are subject to significant seasonal variations, in their ecology and human utilization, it is recommended that flexible seasonal zoning plans are developed to assist in the organization of permitted activities, and to reduce the potential human impacts throughout the year. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Conservation values; Expert judgement; Human impact; Weighted criteria; Wetland management","Aves","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028011609"

Commercial power hand-line fishing was permitted to continue on productive seamount fishing grounds within the reserve because new information enabled boundaries and zoning proposed in the reserve's draft Management Plan to be revised and consistent fisheries regulations to be formulated. The draft plan would have removed access to fishing grounds that provide approximately 25% of the annual regional Australian total allowable catch of the premium fishery species, Blue-eye Trevalla (Hyperoglyphe antarctica). Day-time power handline fishing in 280–550 m depths on Taupo and Barcoo Seamounts avoided Harrisson's Dogfish (Centrophorus harrissoni) – the primary species of conservation concern – because the shark is a diel vertical migrator, residing deeper than Blue-eye during the day before ascending to shallower depths at night to feed on micronekton. Harrisson's Dogfish occurs on several other seamounts where it was previously unrecorded. These results, together with expectation of low mortality of any incidental dogfish bycatch and low impacts on benthic habitats, supported changes to management arrangements which preserve the seamount Blue-eye fishery worth approximately A$1M annually whilst protecting more seamounts and greater areas of benthic habitat in the restricted 200–700 m depth range. Research uptake was facilitated by clarifying policy options at a critical stage in the planning process. This required having clearly articulated management objectives that aligned conservation and fishery imperatives, involving knowledgeable fishers in making robust field observations to address specific knowledge gaps and management needs, and identifying the requirements for ongoing fishery monitoring that addresses remaining management uncertainties. This potential to identify win-win outcomes in the Australian marine planning process provides some general signposts for future policy decisions as marine reserve networks are implemented and reviewed, and for scientists wanting to effectively engage in decision-making processes. © 2016","Fisher participation; Fishery management; Honest brokering; Marine protected areas; Win-win outcome","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959931123"

The aim of this paper is to present a method for integrated sustainability assessment of forest biomass extraction, particularly from bioenergy and biodiversity perspectives. The landscape simulator LandSim was developed and linked with models for the assessment of biomass yields and habitat networks representing prioritised biodiversity components. It was applied in a case study in Kronoberg County in southern Sweden. Forest growth and management were simulated for the period 2010–2110, following two land zoning scenarios, one applying even-aged forest management on all forest land except for protected areas (EAF-tot), and one applying continuous cover forest management on parts of the forest land, combined with protected areas and an intensified even-aged management on the other parts (CCF-int). The EAF-tot scenario implied higher yields of biomass feedstock for bioenergy, the CCF-int scenario only giving 66% of that yield, while the CCF-int scenario performed substantially better when it came to the habitat network indicators, if habitat suitability was ensured. Conclusively, the case study confirmed that the modelling framework of the LEcA tool, linking the landscape simulator LandSim with the biomass yield assessment and the habitat network model can be used for integrating main policy concerns when assessing renewable energy options. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Forest bioenergy; Forest management; Habitat networks; Integrated assessment; Landscape simulation; Trade-off analysis","Kronoberg; Sweden; Biodiversity; Biomass; Conservation; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Extraction; Simulators; Bio-energy; Biodiversity conservation; Even-aged management; Integrated assessment; Landscape simulation; Modelling framework; Sustainability assessment; Trade-off analysis; bioenergy; ecological modeling; forest ecosystem; forest management; habitat structure; integrated approach; network analysis; phytomass; prioritization; protected area; sustainability; trade-off; yield response; Forestry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007040199"

The effects of fishing pressure on the density of three reef fishes were investigated in 21 islands outside (n=15) and inside (n=6) a Marine Protected Area (MPA) at the Paraty Bay, Brazilian southeastern coast. Two valued groupers (Epinephelus marginatus and Mycteroperca acutirostris) and a non-target grunt (Haemulon aurolineatum) were studied. The total biomass of fish caught in each island was considered as a measure of current fishing pressure, while the island distance from the villages was considered as a measure of past fishing pressure. Fish densities were recordedin number and biomass. The biomass of M. acutirostris was inversely related to current fishing pressure, which did not affect the other two fishes. The density of E. marginatus increased with the island distance from one of the fishing villages, which indicated that past fishing may have had decreased the abundance of E. marginatus. Densities of the three fishes and fishing pressure did not differ between islands inside and outside the MPA. Data on fishing pressure, densities of groupers and coral cover were combined here to assign conservation scores to islands. A redefinition of MPA boundaries to reconcile fish conservation, fishing activities and fishers’ food security was proposed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive management; conservation planning; Epinephelus marginatus; Marine protected areas; Mycteroperca acutirostris; Overfishing; Small-scale fisheries; zoning","Brazil; Paraty Bay; Rio de Janeiro [Brazil]; Anthozoa; Epinephelus marginatus; Haemulon aurolineatum; Mycteroperca acutirostris; Pisces; adaptive management; conservation planning; fishery; marine environment; overfishing; perciform; protected area; zoning policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84995480901"

Delimitation, zoning and governance structures are some of the environmental management tools that are provided by MPAs. These management tools may be contentious when human settlements exist within an MPAs’ boundaries, since zoning affects existing human activities and potential developments, and managing structures overlap traditional governance arrangements. Varying perspectives emerge when each stakeholder is taken into consideration separately. Ideally all stakeholders with genuine interests in MPAs should take part in the delimitation, zoning and governance of these areas. However, governance is about reaching agreements amidst differences and is not just a matter of considering differences as singularities. In order to understand how multiple stakeholders would reach a shared environmental governance of an MPA, we took the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park (ECLSP) in The Bahamas as a case study. The ECLSP, created in 1958, is co-managed by the Government of The Bahamas and the Bahamas National Trust (BNT), and contains within its boundaries uninhabited islands, islands occupied by local communities, and private islands mainly owned by foreigners or held in Bahamian trusts. In this study, we conducted an exercise with different stakeholders who were challenged to work together in redrawing the park’s boundaries, zoning and governance structures. Their individual opinions mattered less than the discussion and outcomes of their joint work. We conclude that a shared environmental governance structure does not eliminate all the frictions among stakeholders, but rather it makes them all aware of the natural and social complexities involved in managing MPAs, which improves stewardship and enhances the ECLSP’s legitimacy among stakeholders. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bahamas; Governance; Marine national parks; Participatory process","Bahamas; environmental management; governance approach; human activity; local participation; marine environment; marine park; stakeholder; urban development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013418924"

This share will slightly increase to 1% until 2040 based on a forest conversion programme that focuses on sustainable close to nature forest management recently introduced. In a long-term perspective, a share of 5% should be achieved. However, the theoretical potential for Douglas fir derived from current soil and climate specific tree species recommendations is about 30% (if all other alternative tree species recommendations are excluded). In the short and medium term, potential of regeneration in forest stands of age class VI+ could lead to an increase up to 6.3%. But, one third of this share would be located in forest conservation areas and Natura 2000 sites, where a rather moderate increase of the share of Douglas fir will be tolerated for ecological reasons. However, hitherto there are no requirements for a careful, function-oriented selection of suitable alternative tree species. Moreover, management of Douglas fir in Thuringia needs supportive landscape planning guidelines taking different objectives of forest management and nature conservation into account, e. g. zoning for conservation and development in protected areas. © DLV GmbH.","Forest conservation; Forest conversion; Tree species recommendations","","Short survey","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940669315"

Sampling was conducted at two habitat types (Posidonia oceanica meadows and rocky reefs) that occur at sites of different protection level with respect to fisheries (high protection: seasonal no-take zone within the MPA; intermediate: zones within the MPA where small-scale fishing is allowed; none: areas outside the MPA, where all types of fishing are allowed, including trawlers, purse seiners, and recreational fishing). The data were used to examine the effects of protection level and habitat type on community parameters, trophic structure and functional diversity of fish populations that occupy the upper sublittoral zone. Overall, habitat type had a more pronounced effect than protection level on all investigated parameters. Biomass, density and number of fish species with low commercial value were higher in sites of intermediate protection, but no substantial fisheries-related ecological benefits were detected for targeted fish in the seasonal no-take zone. Conducted 8 years after the initial implementation of the seasonal no-take management scheme, our study suggests that existing fishing regulations in the NMPZ provide some measurable effects, but fall short of maintaining sufficient protection for the recovery of apex predators or other commercially important fish species. A revision of the existing zoning system to include permanent no-take zones, alongside the regulation of professional fishing and all extractive activities in the rest of the MPA, are strongly encouraged in order to enhance the effectiveness of fisheries management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Fish assemblages; Functional diversity; Habitat effect; Ionian sea; Marine protected areas; Mediterranean sea; Partially protected areas; Visual census","Aegean Islands; Greece; Greece; Ionian Islands; Ionian Sea; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea; Zakynthos National Marine Park; Zakynthos [Ionian Islands]; Posidonia oceanica; assessment method; community composition; conservation management; fish; fishery management; habitat type; marine park; seagrass; species conservation; species diversity; trophic structure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045582967"

This approach reduces potential and real conflicts among various stakeholders potentially creating win–win solutions for all. It is particularly applicable in areas where insufficient land for agriculture and settlements is resulting in high rates of conversion of natural forest and grasslands. We quantified and mapped multiple ecosystem services, including habitat provision as a proxy for biodiversity, carbon storage and sequestration, and water balance and supply in the Sarvelat and Javaherdasht region of the globally-significant Hyrcanian (Caspian) forests in northern Iran using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs tool. This region is experiencing a rapidly increasing rate of forest conversion and as a result, the protected area located within the study landscape is threatened by human encroachment. Plausible future landscapes were modeled under three scenarios: (i) business as usual; (ii) protection-based zoning which reflects an expansion of the protected area boundary to prevent land use changes; and (iii) collaborative zoning through redefining the protection boundary simultaneously with an adjustment to meet local stakeholders’ objective of expansion of anthropogenic cover. The results showed that the collaborative zoning scenario would best contribute to effective policy because it presents a more rational spatial configuration of the landscape maintaining the provision of ecosystem services. This scenario may lead to reduced environmental impacts while achieving less conflict between the government and local communities. These results will help to inform and shape natural resource management policies in Iran and is applicable elsewhere in the world. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative zoning; Forested landscape; InVEST; Land conversion; Land use scenario; Mapping","Hyrcania; Iran; decision making; ecosystem modeling; ecosystem service; environmental impact; environmental policy; land use planning; landscape protection; mapping; protected area; resource management; spatial planning; stakeholder; zoning system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85003855317"

Yet almost four decades after the establishment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia's most expensive and intensely researched Marine Protected Area, the health of the Reef is reported to be declining alarmingly. The management of the suite of threats to the health of the reef has clearly been inadequate, even though there have been several notable successes. It is argued that the failure to prioritise correctly all major threats to the reef, coupled with the exaggeration of the benefits of calling the park a protected area and zoning subsets of areas as 'no-take', has distracted attention from adequately addressing the real causes of impact. Australia's marine conservation efforts have been dominated by commitment to a National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas. In so doing, Australia has displaced the internationally accepted primary priority for pursuing effective protection of marine environments with inadequately critical adherence to the principle of having more and bigger marine parks.

The designation objectives and scopes, zoning schemes, management tasks, and environmental requirements of SMPA are different from Marine Natural Reserve (MNR). Different voices from supporters and opponents were raised on this new kind of policy. For a better understanding on this policy, we analyzed SMPA and its relationship and difference with MNR, dissected development of SMPAs in China, and discussed its governance, management and experiences. The main findings are: (1) SMPA policy is a complementary strategy for MNR policy. SMPA policy can reduce the conflicts and narrow the gap between conservation and local economic development; (2) The coverage of SMPA has sharply increased since the establishment of the first national SMPA in 2005,which demonstrates the Chinese government has paid great attention to multiple-use of marine resources in order to achieve sustainable development. (3) Lack of financial funding, baseline data and scientific research are affecting the effectiveness of conservation and management of SMPA policy. In order to ameliorate the SMPA policy, we suggest (1) making overall strategic planning for multiple-use of marine resources, (2) coordinating the role of central government and local government, and considering the up-bottom system as a complement, and (3) increasing financial support from central government and local government, accumulating baseline data, and conducting systematic scientific research. Given all the features of SMPA Policy, we considered it as an emerging and key mechanism for protection of marine ecosystem and a trade-off between ecological conservation and economic development in China. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","","China; Conservation; Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental protection; Marine biology; Natural resources; Oceanography; Ecological conservation; Economic activities; Economic development; Environmental requirement; Local economic development; Marine conservations; Marine protected area; Scientific researches; economic development; governance approach; local government; marine ecosystem; marine resource; protected area; trade-off; Public policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84875274111"

The development of this system will proceed primarily through the implementation of ecological, social, and governance MPA networks at the sub-national scale. We describe six case studies that exemplify different approaches taken to develop MPA networks in the Coral Triangle region at different scales: Nusa Penida in Indonesia; Tun Mustapha Park in Malaysia; Kimbe Bay in Papua New Guinea; Verde Island Passage in the Philippines; The Lauru Ridges to Reefs Protected Area Network in Choiseul, Solomon Islands; and Nino Konis Santana Park in Timor Leste. Through synthesis of these case studies, we identify five common themes that contributed to successful outcomes: (1) the need for multi-stakeholder and cross-level management institutions; (2) the value of integrating cutting-edge science with local knowledge and community-based management; (3) the importance of building local capacity; (4) using multiple-use zoning to balance competing objectives; and (5) participation in learning and governance networks. These lessons will be invaluable in guiding future efforts to expand the Coral Triangle Marine Protected Area System, and provide important insights for MPA practitioners elsewhere. © 2014 Copyright © Rebecca Weeks, Porfirio M.

Estuarine tidal flats are speciose and provide vital ecosystem services but are largely neglected in MPA research. Here, the ecological effect of an MPA on an estuarine tidal flat was determined by quantifying patterns in macroinvertebrate assemblages and sediment variables over a 3 yr period: 1 yr prior to and 2 yr following MPA zoning. An asymmetrical beyond BACI (before after control impact) design was used with 1 protected and 2 reference tidal flats. Following the exclusion of humans targeting callianasid crustaceans for bait, significant changes in the assemblages were observed in the no-take zone compared to reference locations. These shifts were maintained for the 2 yr of sampling following zoning. Relatively immobile, suspension- and deposit-feeding species increased up to 6-fold in abundance, especially juvenile bivalves (e.g. Eumarcia fumigata and Soletellina alba) and small polychaetes. In contrast, there was a reduction in some of the highly mobile, predatory and scavenging species (e.g. the amphipod Urohaustorius metungi and the polychaete Sigalion ovigerum). We observed an increase in spatial homogeneity in the assemblage as well as increases in the silt and clay content at the protected flat, while patchiness was maintained at the reference sites. Importantly, these results add to the growing body of evidence that MPAs also significantly affect non-target fauna and produce shifts in beta-diversity. Our findings imply that MPAs are an effective tool for conservation management. © Inter-Research 2014.","Beta-diversity; Estuary; Invertebrates; Marine protected areas; Soft sediment","Bivalvia; Crustacea; Invertebrata; Polychaeta; Sigalion; bait; biodiversity; conservation management; ecosystem service; macroinvertebrate; marine park; tidal flat; zoning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84919449271"

However, its development presents several challenging features. Sometimes, the biological aspects of the protected areas are poorly considered in the final zoning, which becomes a controversial issue, since the biological conservation is the main objective of these areas. Herein, we propose an index to evaluate the biological relevance of different landscape units (Biological Importance Value - BIV), specially tailored for the zoning of protected areas. We also present a case study where the BIV was used for zoning the Serra do Tombador Natural Reserve (RNST). A layer of spatial information was produced attributing a BIV value for each landscape entity. This layer was included in a weighted overlay framework with the vegetation types, hydrograph, and roads. We found eight different biological relevance levels in the RNST. These values composed the basis for the final reserve zoning. The BIV associated with the weighted overlay framework reflected the observed faunal distribution in the area and represents an important tool for the implementation of protected areas management practices. © 2014 by Unisinos.","Biological relevance index; Protected areas zoning; Serra do Tombador Natural Reserve; Weighted overlay","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901397566"

The present study examined shark distribution patterns, species-habitat associations, and marine reserve use with baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) along the entire Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) over a ten year period. Overall, 21 species of sharks from five families and two orders were recorded. Grey reef Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, silvertip C. albimarginatus, tiger Galeocerdo cuvier, and sliteye Loxodon macrorhinus sharks were the most abundant species (>64% of shark abundances). Multivariate regression trees showed that hard coral cover produced the primary split separating shark assemblages. Four indicator species had consistently higher abundances and contributed to explaining most of the differences in shark assemblages: C. amblyrhynchos, C. albimarginatus, G. cuvier, and whitetip reef Triaenodon obesus sharks. Relative distance along the GBRMP had the greatest influence on shark occurrence and species richness, which increased at both ends of the sampling range (southern and northern sites) relative to intermediate latitudes. Hard coral cover and distance across the shelf were also important predictors of shark distribution. The relative abundance of sharks was significantly higher in non-fished sites, highlighting the conservation value and benefits of the GBRMP zoning. However, our results also showed that hard coral cover had a large effect on the abundance of reef-associated shark species, indicating that coral reef health may be important for the success of marine protected areas. Therefore, understanding shark distribution patterns, species-habitat associations, and the drivers responsible for those patterns is essential for developing sound management and conservation approaches. © 2014 Espinoza et al.","","Animals; Australia; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Oceans and Seas; Poisson Distribution; Predatory Behavior; Regression Analysis; Sharks; Species Specificity; Time Factors; coral reef; driver; family; indicator organism; latitude; sampling; shark; sound; species habitat; species richness; statistical model; tiger; videorecording; animal; Australia; ecosystem; environmental protection; fishery; Poisson distribution; predation; regression analysis; sea; species difference; statistics and numerical data; time","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84911809306"

We use the conceptualization and operationalization of social resilience proposed by Marshall and Marshall (2007) to investigate how resilience level influenced commercial fishers' perceptions about and adaptation to the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. We conducted face-to-face interviews with 114 commercial and charter fishers to measure their social resilience level and their responses and adaptation strategies to the 2004 zoning plan. Fishers with higher resilience were more likely to believe that the zoning plan was necessary, more likely to be supportive of the plan, and more likely to have adapted their fishing business and fishing activity to the plan than were fishers with lower social resilience. High-resilience fishers were also less likely to perceive negative impacts of the plan on their fishing business, less likely to have negative attitudes toward the consultation process used to develop and implement the plan, and less likely to have applied for financial compensation under the structural adjustment program. Results confirm the utility of the social resilience construct for identifying fishers who are likely to be vulnerable to changes, and those who are struggling to cope with change events. We conclude that managing for social resilience in the GBR would aid in the design and implementation of policies that minimize the impacts on resource users and lead to more inclusive and sustainable management, but that further research is necessary to better understand social resilience, how it can be fostered and sustained, and how it can be effectively incorporated into management. © 2012 by the author(s).","Commercial fishing; Great barrier reef; Marine protected area zoning; Social resilience","Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Pacific Ocean; Queensland; adaptive management; fishing community; marine park; nature conservation; perception; zoning policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867128588"

They prefer bear conservation in protected areas and they are more averse to conservation in residential areas. However, they support coexistence with bears in general. Moreover, residents' attitudes become more negative with closer proximity between bear habitats and their residences. In addition, the occupations of local residents also affect their preferences.

The model comprised 80 functional groups (more than 200 species). The JBMP is a multiple use-marine park with several types of zoning and the effects of these on rock lobster biomass, mortalities and landings were explored using five Ecospace scenarios as baselines: (1) no-take Sanctuary Zones covering 4% of the total area; area of Sanctuary Zones changed to (2) 25%, (3) 50%; (4) 0%, i.e. No Sanctuary Zones; and (5) combining 25% of no-take areas with a 50% reduction in fishing mortality of the main targeted species. The results suggest that the introduction of the current management zones with 4% of the area in Sanctuary Zones produced a modest increase of ∼5% in the biomass of western rock lobster after 20 years, even with stable fishing effort. However, Western Rock Lobster biomass increased by ∼20% when the Sanctuary Zones covered 25% of the Park. Similar trends were observed for exploited fish species such as pink snapper, dhufish, and small sharks with their biomasses predicted to increase by up to 30% as the area of sanctuary zones increase from 4% to 50%. The largest predicted increases in biomass for the main target species were found when the protection from the sanctuaries (25%) was combined with a 50% reduction of fishing pressure. The catch of finfish species improved up to 70% (e.g. pink snapper) when a 25% of no-take area simulated was combined with a 50% reduction of fishing mortality during 20 years. To test the effects of habitat structure on the effectiveness of these fishing closures, a set of four scenarios were developed. We relocated the current 4% of sanctuaries, which are mainly associated with a reef-seagrass habitat, to the other three major habitats (reefs, seagrass and sand). The predicted fish biomass was higher when sanctuaries were placed on high structured habitats, such as reefs and seagrass-reefs (10-90%) than seagrass and sandy areas. © 2012.","Ecospace; Ecosystem model; Fishing impact; Marine protected area; Sanctuary zones; Western rock lobster","Australia; Jurien Bay Marine Park; Western Australia; Chondrichthyes; Panulirus; Panulirus cygnus; Biomass; Fisheries; Reefs; Rocks; Seaweed; Shellfish; Ecospace; Ecosystem model; Fishing impact; Marine protected area; Sanctuary zones; Western rock lobster; biomass; coral reef; ecosystem modeling; fishing mortality; functional group; habitat restoration; habitat structure; lobster fishery; marine ecosystem; marine park; mortality; remediation; seagrass; Ecosystems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84866034899"

Our results showed that urban expansion around protected areas will continue to be a major threat, and expand by 67% under business-as-usual conditions. Concomitantly, a substantial number of protected areas will lose natural vegetation in their surroundings. National land-use policies or changes in crop prices are not likely to affect the overall pattern of land use, but can have effects in certain regions. Discouraging urbanization through zoning, for example, can reduce future urban pressures around National Forests and Refuges in the East, while the implementation of an afforestation policy can increase the amount of natural vegetation around some Refuges throughout the U.S. On the other hand, increases in crop prices can increase crop/pasture cover around some protected areas, and limit the potential recovery of natural vegetation. Overall, our results highlight that future land-use change around protected areas is likely to be substantial but variable among regions and protected area types. Safeguarding the conservation value of protected areas may require serious consideration of threats and opportunities arising from future land use. © 2015.","Anthropogenic threat; Econometric model; Land-use change; Protected areas","United States; anthropogenic effect; conservation management; econometrics; land use change; land use planning; policy implementation; protected area; refuge; urban growth; urbanization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924608954"

The establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) is considered essential for conserving the marine environment and biodiversity. However, a number of natural and social factors influence the planning process for MPAs, with effects on the exact conservation strategy adopted. Sometimes social interests dominate and the final zoning of the MPA fails to meet the initial conservation criteria, which were recommended on the basis of scientific results. Geographic Information Systems (GIS), with their derived and specific applications, provide new opportunities for zoning and management of the marine environment. These tools facilitate analysis of large datasets and allow integration of more information into the MPA planning process. There is already a database full of geo-referenced information about marine habitat distribution, communities, endangered species and human activities, around La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain). We analyzed this information, using GIS tools and the algorithm Marxan, and presented seven alternative MPA zones in the sublittoral environment around La Palma. This is the first time that an objective and systematic process, combining knowledge about human activities as well as conservation status, has been used to establish the suitable placement of MPAs in the Canary Islands. The zoning recommended by this study differs significantly from that currently in place. We suggest there is a need to redesign La Palma’s outdated conservation strategies by redefining the size, shape and location of its MPAs. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biodiversity; Canary Islands; Marine management; Marine reserve; Marxan; Spatial planning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925516148"

The optimal zoning of protected ecological areas belongs to a NP-hard problem because it is subject to both box and spatial constraints. A challenge in solving area optimization problems emerges with the increasing size of a study region. In this article, an integrated approach of remote sensing, GIS and modified ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed for application in zoning protected ecological areas. Significant modifications have been made in the conventional ACO so that it can be further extended to solve zoning problems in large regions. An improved selection strategy is designed to accelerate the progress of sites selection for artificial ants. Another important modification in ACO is to incorporate the neighborhood diffusion strategy into pheromone updating. The optimal objective is to generate protected areas that maximize both ecological suitability and spatial compactness. The modified ACO model has been successfully applied to a case study involving an area of 25,483 cells in Dongguan, Guangdong, China. The experiments have demonstrated that the proposed model is an efficient and effective optimization technique for generating optimal protection. The modified ACO model only requires approximately 119 s for determining near-optimal solutions. Furthermore, the proposed method performs better than other methods, including simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, iterative relaxation, basic ACO, and density slicing. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","ACO; GIS; Protected ecological areas; Remote sensing; Zoning","China; Dongguan; Guangdong; Formicidae; artificial intelligence; experimental study; genetic algorithm; GIS; integrated approach; land use change; numerical model; optimization; pheromone; protected area; remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856427867"

A comprehensive array of acoustic receivers was deployed at two near-shore coastal sites in south-eastern Australia, to examine the movements, activity-space size and residency of a temperate rocky-reef, herbivorous species Girella elevata. Twenty-four G. elevata individuals were internally tagged with pressure-sensing acoustic transmitters across these two arrays and monitored for up to 550 days. An existing network of coastal receivers was used to examine large-scale movement patterns. Individuals exhibited varying residency, but all had small activity-space sizes within the arrays. The species utilised shallow rocky-reef habitat, displaying unimodal or bimodal patterns in depth use. A positive correlation was observed between wind speed and the detection depth of fish, with fish being likely to move to deeper water to escape periods of adverse conditions. Detection frequency data, corrected using sentinel tags, generally illustrated diurnal behaviour. Patterns of habitat usage, residency and spatial utilisation highlighted the susceptibility of G. elevata to recreational fishing pressure. The results from the present study will further contribute to the spatial information required in the zoning of effective marine protected areas, and our understanding of temperate reef fish ecology. © CSIRO 2015.","Girella elevata; home range; marine protected areas; movement; residency; residency index; sentinel transmitters.","Australia; Girella elevata; acoustic array; activity pattern; biotelemetry; habitat use; marine ecosystem; movement; perciform; protected area; reef; Sentinel; spatial analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929927426"

Aerial surveys conducted to estimate the species density and abundance along the continental shelf of the Eastern Brazilian Coast revealed important core areas at the southern portion of the Abrolhos Bank. The rapid growth of human activities in these coastal areas motivated the use of Geographic Information Systems as a tool to guide the identification of priority areas for the species conservation. The species distribution was modelled using a kernel density estimator. The corresponding layer was used to identify areas of overlay with components of maritime traffic and with hydrocarbon exploitation areas. The resulting risk map was overlaid with existent Marine Protected Areas, allowing the cartography of areas where management measures still need to be undertaken to ensure habitat protection.

However, whilst these software tools are designed to identify MPA networks that both represent biodiversity and minimize impacts on stakeholders, they do not consider complex ecological processes. Thus, it is difficult to determine the impacts that proposed MPAs could have on marine ecosystem health, fisheries and fisheries sustainability. Using the eastern English Channel as a case study, this paper explores an approach to address these issues by identifying a series of MPA networks using the Marxan and Marxan with Zones conservation planning software and linking them with a spatially explicit ecosystem model developed in Ecopath with Ecosim. We then use these to investigate potential trade-offs associated with adopting different MPA management strategies. Limited-take MPAs, which restrict the use of some fishing gears, could have positive benefits for conservation and fisheries in the eastern English Channel, even though they generally receive far less attention in research on MPA network design. Our findings, however, also clearly indicate that no-take MPAs should form an integral component of proposed MPA networks in the eastern English Channel, as they not only result in substantial increases in ecosystem biomass, fisheries catches and the biomass of commercially valuable target species, but are fundamental to maintaining the sustainability of the fisheries. Synthesis and applications. Using the existing software tools Marxan with Zones and Ecopath with Ecosim in combination provides a powerful policy-screening approach. This could help inform marine spatial planning by identifying potential conflicts and by designing new regulations that better balance conservation objectives and stakeholder interests. In addition, it highlights that appropriate combinations of no-take and limited-take marine protected areas might be the most effective when making trade-offs between long-term ecological benefits and short-term political acceptability. © 2015 British Ecological Society.","Ecopath with Ecosim; Ecospace; Marine spatial zoning; Marine trophic index; Marxan; Marxan with Zones; Systematic conservation planning","English Channel; biomass; conservation planning; ecoregion; ecosystem health; fishery management; fishing gear; habitat conservation; marine park; prioritization; software; stakeholder; sustainable development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929654861"

Existing ecological restoration measures are singular and lack pertinence and systematicness. Thus, a gap between the expectations and real ecological restoration effects exists. This study was based on Haizhouwan National Marine Park, a national MPA of China. After investigating and evaluating the ecological environment in the Haizhouwan protected area (HPA), ecosystem health assessments to three ecological subsystems (i.e., island terrestrial, intertidal, and neritic ecosystems) and vulnerability assessments to the main protected objects (i.e., landforms) were conducted. This study was integrated with the functional zonation of the HPA, which enabled it to conduct an analytic hierarchy process for the assessment results to obtain ecological restoration zoning. According to the zoning, the HPA can be divided into 12 ecological restoration zones, namely, 2 key restoration zones, 3 general restoration zones, 2 taking-into-account restoration zones, and 5 maintaining-the-status zones. This paper also provides pertinent ecological restoration measures and recommendations to the environmental, ecological, and protected object problems existing in different zones. The study results can provide empirical references for the development of ecological restoration plans and measures for the HPA.

Protected area zoning is an approach that can reduce conflict by partitioning the landscape into various land use units that are managed for different levels of human activity. In this paper, we present a systematic methodology that integrates a participatory process with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique to guide a zoning scheme for the Meili Snow Mountain National Park (MSMNP), Yunnan. A participatory process involving multiple stakeholders and technical experts was used to establish park management objectives: nature conservation; tourism and recreation; and, community development. To meet these three objectives, criteria and impact factors for each objective were identified and weighted through a participatory process, and a GIS fuzzy set membership function was then used to generate gradient effects of each criterion. Three suitability maps of conservation, eco-tourism, and community development were generated. The three suitability maps were overlaid to generate a final combined suitability map, and five management zones (strict protected zone, ecosystem conservation zone, eco-tourism zone or buffer zone, park service zone, and traditional land use zone) were identified and mapped that corresponded to different protection and management strategies. Conservation targets (endangered species, alpine and forest ecosystems) and development zones were spatially segregated across the landscape, and the final zoning scheme was found to be acceptable by the various stakeholders. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","Management zoning designation; Meili Snow Mountain National Park; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Participatory process; Protected area zoning","China; Yunnan; decision analysis; ecotourism; GIS; multicriteria analysis; nature conservation; nature reserve; park management; participatory approach; protected area; stakeholder; zoning policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84880039603"

Despite holding positive attitudes towards marine biodiversity protection, fishers were generally unsupportive of the new zoning plan 5 years after its implementation. Fishers' lack of support was related to the perception that they had not been adequately engaged in the rezoning process and the perception of significant impacts of the zoning plan on fishing businesses. Fishers generally believed that the new zoning plan had a negative impact on their access to productive fishing areas, the numbers of fish they catch, the profitability of their fishing business, and their personal income. In response to the new no-take zones, fishers tended to redistribute their fishing activity to locations closer to their home port, and to locations already known to them through their previous fishing, resulting in an increase in high density fishing locations within the park. Despite the impacts that fishers experienced, most reported that they have adapted their fishing activity and fishing business at least moderately well to the new zoning plan, suggesting that many of the impacts experienced by fishers might be short-term and may decline over time as fishers learn to adapt to the new zoning system.

The purpose of this study is environmental impact assessment of the industrial estate development planning. Methods. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2010 in Isfahan province, Iran. GIS and matrix methods were applied. Data analysis was done to identify the current situation of the region, zoning vulnerable areas, and scoping the region. Quantitative evaluation was done by using matrix of Wooten and Rau. Results. The net score for impact of industrial units operation on air quality of the project area was (-3). According to the transition of industrial estate pollutants, residential places located in the radius of 2500 meters of the city were expected to be affected more. The net score for impact of construction of industrial units on plant species of the project area was (-2). Environmental protected areas were not affected by the air and soil pollutants because of their distance from industrial estate. Conclusion. Positive effects of project activities outweigh the drawbacks and the sum scores allocated to the project activities on environmental factor was (+37). Totally it does not have detrimental effects on the environment and residential neighborhood. EIA should be considered as an anticipatory, participatory environmental management tool before determining a plan application. © 2012 Mohammad Ghasemian et al.","","Air Pollution; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environment; Environmental Pollution; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Industry; Iran; Models, Statistical; Social Change; Soil Pollutants; ground water; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; article; building industry; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; gas; geographic information system; industrial estate development plan; Iran; matrix method; methodology; particulate matter; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; residential area; soil pollutant; water quality; wildlife conservation; cross-sectional study; environment; geographic information system; human; industry; pollution; social change; statistical model; statistics; utilization review","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856404457"

For large protected areas zoning concepts are intended to ensure an environmentally compatible location of the wind turbines. In this context, the pilot project ""Site identification of Locations for wind energy plants in the natural park Altmühltal - Zoning concept"" analysed options to reliably identify suitable sites in protected areas in a short timescale on the basis of existing data. The study developed criteria to differentiate site categories and precautionary buffer zones. The zoning concept defined 'taboo zones' as well as 'exceptional zones' in which the establishment of wind energy plants can be possible without affecting the reserve's protective purpose. In 'decision zones' further examinations are still necessary, mostly due to a lack of available data. The transferability of the method to other Bavarian natural parks and landscape reserves has been established.","","Germany; data acquisition; landscape; timescale; wind farm; wind power; zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84883409243"

Attempts to maintain and restore marine biodiversity are becoming more spatial, principally through the designation of marine protected areas (MPAs). MPAs compete for space with other uses, and the emergence of new industries, such as marine renewable energy generation, will increase competition for space. Decision makers require guidance on how to zone the ocean to conserve biodiversity, mitigate conflict and accommodate multiple uses. Here we used empirical data and freely available planning software to identified priority areas for multiple ocean zones, which incorporate goals for biodiversity conservation, two types of renewable energy, and three types of fishing. We developed an approached to evaluate trade-offs between industries and we investigated the impacts of co-locating some fishing activities within renewable energy sites. We observed non-linear trade-offs between industries. We also found that different subsectors within those industries experienced very different trade-off curves. Incorporating co-location resulted in significant reductions in cost to the fishing industry, including fisheries that were not co-located. Co-location also altered the optimal location of renewable energy zones with planning solutions. Our findings have broad implications for ocean zoning and marine spatial planning. In particular, they highlight the need to include industry subsectors when assessing trade-offs and they stress the importance of considering co-location opportunities from the outset. Our research reinforces the need for multi-industry ocean-zoning and demonstrates how it can be undertaken within the framework of strategic conservation planning. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Fisheries management; Marine protected areas; Marine spatial planning; Off-shore wind farms; Tidal energy","Conservation of Natural Resources; Fisheries; Northern Ireland; Oceans and Seas; Renewable Energy; biodiversity; conservation planning; decision making; fishery management; marine park; offshore application; renewable resource; software; spatial planning; strategic approach; sustainability; tidal power; trade-off; wind farm; Article; computer program; conservation biology; cost; energy conservation; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental protection; fishery; fishery management; fishing; food industry; marine environment; ocean zoning; renewable energy; tidal power; environmental protection; procedures; sea; United Kingdom","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923004117"

Originally used in the nineteenth century to refer to protected areas that should be conserved for the consumption of outstanding scenery and natural beauty for the beneﬁt of visitors, the term is now often used as a ‘catch-all’ by members of the public to refer to protected areas of national environmental and cultural signiﬁcance. This situation is not helped by the fact that many national park agencies manage more than just national parks as well as the number of diﬀerent types of protected areas. The IUCN has six diﬀerent categories of protected area with national parks usually being a component of a wider system of protected areas. However, some jurisdictions have even more categories, For example, in Austria there are 12 diﬀerent types of protected areas and 11 in Germany (Mose and Wixlbaumer 2007). In addition, ‘one cannot deny a certain image-hierachy between the diﬀerent categories. In contrast to the prestigious and ﬁnancially lucrative Category II (national park), the Category V (protected landscape) receives only little attention’ (Mose and Wixlbaumer 2007: 5). This is despite the signiﬁcant spatial area occupied by protected landscapes (see Chapter 1), and especially in Europe where it is by far the most substantial protected area category in terms of area occupied. According to Mose and Wixlbaumer (2007: 5) there are several reasons for the dominance of ‘national parks’ over other categories of protected areas in the public and policy imagination: • The outstanding image of national parks as the ‘premium category of the protected areas’; • The stringent legal and spatial planning rules underlying the national parks (for example statutues instead of regulations, zoning of activities); Furthermore, and perhaps not surprisingly, many people often do not recognize the diﬀerences that exist between the diﬀerent types of protected areas or, in some cases, the concept is alien to their world-view (e.g. Kalternborn 1994, Neumann 1998, Proctor 1998, Stoll-Kleemann 2001, Trakolis 2001a, 2001b, Hall and Piggin 2002, Kächele and Dabbert 2002, Kalternborn et al. 2002, McLean and Stræde 2003, Middleton 2003, Phillips 2003, Mascarenhas and Scarce 2004, Hovardas and Poirazidis 2007, Schenk et al. 2007). © 2009 Warwick Frost and C.

To date, bionomic and diagnostic cartographic approaches have been commonly used to support decision-making in the selection, zoning and management of marine protected areas (MPAs), with a range of practical tools developed for this purpose. In addition to these, new and emerging technologies have the potential for generating better information for scientists, managers and other stakeholders alike, such as underwater survey tools, three dimensional (3D) visualisation systems and interactive web platforms. These new methodologies allow taking into account the spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of the marine environment, to be managed for conservation. This paper reviews emerging and innovative technologies for marine mapping and marine spatial planning with a special focus on their use in MPA management. These include the generation and use of benthic cartography, scientific visualisation of ecosystem analyses, web-based GIS platforms and their final use as decision-support tools. Seafloor mapping technology has been improved and become more affordable for local scale MPA management purposes. However, the lack of coherent local scale spatial data still remains an issue, limiting the power of diagnostic cartography analyses within MPAs. The proposed framework can improve the generation and dissemination of cartographic and visual data, and allow for management approaches based on scientific knowledge and EBM principles, taking into account stakeholders needs. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","diagnostic cartography; GIS; marine protected areas; seafloor mapping; spatial decision-support tools; technology","cartography; decision making; decision support system; ecosystem management; GIS; mapping; marine environment; marine park; seafloor; spatial planning; spatial variation; stakeholder; temporal variation; visualization","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044936017"

Given the area's remoteness, poor infrastructure, high population growth and limited exchanges across the Omani border, the local livelihoods strongly rely on the exploitation of natural marine and terrestrial resources. Since quantitative data on the intensity of anthropogenic pressure on the terrestrial ecosystem are lacking, the present study analysed the impact of agricultural and pastoral land use on the vegetation of the designated Hawf Protected Area (HPA). To this end structured interviews, village walks and other rural appraisal tools were combined with vegetation surveys and GPS-based monitoring of pasturing livestock herds. The loss of traditional herding systems that regulated selective management of fragile grazing grounds along the altitude gradient in the HPA, particularly for camels, the overexploitation of woody perennials for construction purposes, and the resettlement of former migrant workers are major constraints for the successful implementation of the government-designed management plan. Implementation could be improved by better taking into account the vegetation composition in the area, current and traditional grazing schemes and local people's needs for off-farm income. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Anogeissus dhofarica; Cloud forest; Deforestation; Grazing management; Shifting cultivation; Subsistence agriculture","Yemen; cloud forest; data set; deforestation; GPS; grazing management; land use change; livestock farming; management practice; population growth; protected area; rural area; shifting cultivation; subsistence agriculture; zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84902580931"

We asked what were the potential gains and losses in terms of fishing effort and species conservation of different planning scenarios. Given a conservation target of 10 % representation of each biotope, the fishery need not lose more than 20 % of its fishing grounds to give way to cost-efficient conservation of benthic diversity.

Yet despite the significant differences between marine and terrestrial systems in terms of their critical ecological processes, stresses, and relationships with cultural systems, methods used to characterize levels of protection for biological diversity in MPAs are all derived from schemes developed for terrestrial systems. A new system designed to classify levels of protection in MPAs is proposed, based on criteria specifically relevant to marine systems. MPAs are characterized by each of the seven criteria: designated use, quality of natural character, extent of protection throughout the year, extent of zoning into sub-areas for multiple uses, public access, extraction of resources, and size with respect to supporting critical ecological processes. Five levels of protection are defined, labeled I-V: Wilderness Management Area (Level I), Research Management Area, Ecological Management Area, Human Recreation Management Area, and Sustainable Resource Management Area (V). A level is assigned to an MPA based on the level that matches the largest number of categories across all seven criteria. The uses and benefits of this system of classification relative to existing systems are discussed and examples of its application are illustrated using data on 83.

However, compliance with such measures is rarely quantified. Aerial and land-based coastal observation surveys were conducted within Ningaloo Marine Park, north-western Australia, with the aim of identifying the spatio-temporal distribution of recreational fishing as well as quantifying participation and zoning compliance. During aerial and coastal surveys, a recreational activity type was identified for 73% and 65% of observed vessels, respectively. About 16-17% of vessels were identified as being engaged in recreational fishing and, of these, 8-12% were observed while fishing in sanctuary zones. For people undertaking shore-based recreation, identification of activity type increased to 97% for aerial surveys and 100% for coastal surveys. Participation in shore-based recreational fishing was 9% for both survey methods and 2-4% of these fishers were observed in sanctuary zones. Peak visitor months (April-October) had a wider spatial distribution and higher density of shore and vessel-based fishers. Interviews with recreational fishers enabled collection of data about knowledge of zoning, and compliance with bag and size limits. For repeat visitors, 87% could correctly identify the location of the nearest sanctuary zone; for first time visitors this dropped to 52%. About 75% of both visitor types stated that these zones had not affected their fishing activity. No fishers had reached their bag limit and only two undersized fish were recorded in the examined catches. The multi-faceted survey approach revealed that aerial and coastal surveys produced similar data on non-compliance. Such data can be used to develop site-specific enforcement and education activities as well as providing support for planning and management of marine parks. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Aerial survey; Land-based coastal survey; Marine protected area","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84858724419"

This paper focuses on site prioritisation for marine protected areas, a process that usually imposes moderate to heavy demands on data, time, local expertise, and funds. A fuzzy logic decision support tool for zoning marine areas that is suitable for use in data poor conditions is developed. This tool, the Protected Area Suitability Index (PASI), assesses the suitability of sites for protection based on fishers' preferences for that site and the site's conservation value. Only eight input attributes are required to run the PASI, which operates on a series of heuristic rules to estimate a site suitability score that ranges from 0 to 10, where 10 indicates that a site is highly suitable for being protected from fishing. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the PASI is relatively robust, and produces reliable results even as the system is degraded by the loss of data. Eighteen actively fished sites and 11 sites that are closed to fishing are assessed to evaluate how well the PASI is able to distinguish differences between sites. The estimated scores are significantly different (p<0.05), whereby non-fished sites are scored as being more suitable for protection than fished sites. The PASI can be used as a decision support tool to facilitate systematic marine spatial management under data poor conditions, especially in the task of identifying suitable sites for protection. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Data poor fisheries; Fisher behaviour; Fuzzy logic; Malaysia; Marine spatial management; Sabah","East Malaysia; Malaysia; Sabah; decision support system; fishery management; fuzzy mathematics; marine park; prioritization; sensitivity analysis; spatial planning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84861691406"

For territory of Kazakhstan are the most promising following types of renewable energy sources: wind energy (929 billion kWh/year); energy of water (total hydro potential - 170 billion kWh/year, technically possible to implement - 62 billion kWh/year, of which about 8.0 billion kWh/year - potential of small hydropower plants); solar energy (photovoltaic systems and solar collectors, solar energy potential estimated at 2.5 billion kWh/year, development of solar energy promote the world's largest reserves of silicon raw materials (85 million tons). Modern computer technology, such as geographic information systems (GIS) allow to construct tools providing partial automation computing energy potential the area. However, for building tools based on GIS technology demanded the implementation of analysis elaborations past years and working out methodological support automated process calculation bioenergy potential. For identifying potential and prospects development of renewable energy sources in Kazakhstan by means GIS technology requires data which can be divided into the following groups: Maps of natural climatic conditions that determine the possibility of using those or other energy installations by geographical location. Maps reference books, such as maps length of daylight seasonal, with a description of parameters required for installation solar panels and orientation.

Maximising results and minimising cost and time is the goal, using a methodology that re evaluates existing information on the area, allows use of physical, environmental and socio-economic indicators, and finally integrates information in a Geographic Information System capable of generating outputs in the form of thematic maps to support managers.The final products obtained inform planners and managers about the study areas, across multiple aspects that all need to be considered in integrated coastal management. Although originally proposed for widespread use in the Mediterranean, this methodology can be flexibly adapted, with minor modifications in the selection of indicators, for its use in other regions.

The environmental variables considered for the model were: depth; slope; habitat type and heterogeneity; wave exposure; and MPA zoning. A total of 378 transects were randomly distributed with a total of 149,000 m2 surveyed at a depth range from 4.2 to 46 m. The recorded P. nobilis densities are among the highest in the Mediterranean Sea. With respect to the prediction model, results indicate that benthic habitats play a key role in the spatial distribution of P. nobilis, with higher densities in seagrass meadows of Posidonia oceanica. The fan mussel population density peaked at 9 m depth, decreasing with depth. Also, decreasing densities are expected with increasing exposure to waves.

While local actors, private and public, face management and opportunity costs due to conservation policies, the benefits reach beyond local borders. In this paper, we argue that a successful biodiversity conservation policy mix should include economic instruments directed at public and private local stakeholders. These instruments should be mutually reinforcing and target decision processes regarding land-use zoning and land management practices. To illustrate our argument, we focus on European agri-environmental measures (directed at private landowners) and ecological fiscal transfers (for local governments). We describe each of these instruments and derive main lessons from their implementation. Finally, we present proposals for linking them to reinforce their individual contributions to the overall goal of halting biodiversity loss, taking the Portuguese case as an example.

Since then, the road network has expanded from the Indian boarder, often tracing traditional trails. This has accelerated commerce as well as movement of people from India, benefitting both the Bhutanese and foreign tourists. At the same time, dependence on imported automobiles and fossil fuel has risen, and roadless areas have begun to shrink. This brought an inevitable loss of traditional environmental knowledge, such as the care of mules for packing, and reduction in physical and mental health among the Bhutanese. People who lost jobs as horsemen moved into towns to find jobs. Road extension is also a double-edged sword for visitors. It has resulted in shrinking trekking areas and loss of traditional culture, both of which have been sacrificed for easy access. Protected areas often function as fortifications against mechanical civilization. However, protected-area status or its zoning does not guarantee that an area will remain roadless where there is considerable resident population. An analysis in Jigme Dorji National Park showed the gradual retreat of trailheads and increasing dependence on automobiles among residents and trekkers. B. MacKaye, a regional planner in the Eastern United States, proposed using trails as a tool to control such mechanical civilization. His philosophy of regional planning suggests two measures; one is consolidated trailheads as dams, and the other is confinement of roads by levees, consisting of new trails and wilderness belts. According to case studies, the author proposed six options for coexistence of trails with roads. © 2011 by the authors.","Bhutan; Inhabited wilderness; Roadless area; Traditional environmental knowledge; Trailhead; Trekking","Bhutan; Jigme Dorji National Park; Conservation; Fossil fuels; Regional planning; Bhutan; Environmental knowledge; Inhabited wilderness; Roadless areas; Trailhead; Trekking; environmental planning; recreational activity; regional planning; road construction; sustainability; traditional knowledge; wilderness area; Roads and streets","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84869226532"

The latter was created under a co-management regime to reduce conflicts among users arising over incompatible demands for ocean space, to mitigate the impact of human activities on sensitive ecological areas, and to contribute to the sustainability of Galapagos fisheries.

The implementation of multiple-use MPAs increases the challenges of communicating awareness of MPA boundaries and permitted activities. Currently, little is known about how effective signage in multiple-use MPAs is in communicating information to stakeholders that will promote supportive attitudes and behaviours towards MPAs. This study evaluated the usefulness of in-situ signage in an existing multiple-use MPA, to determine if signs pertaining to the MPA captured the attention of recreational users, and provided adequate information. Structured interviews with recreational fishers, divers, and other users, were used to determine users' awareness of being in an MPA, their awareness of management objectives and associated zoning scheme, together with levels of agreement or disagreement on whether or not current in-situ signage adequately communicates information about the MPA. It was evident that the types and accessibility of in-situ signs in the MPA may not be effective at capturing the attention of intended audiences and providing relevant information, with the exception of signs located at the dive site, due to their design, size, and placement. Awareness differed among the three user groups, together with their views on the effectiveness of signage. Many recreational fishers believed existing signage was inadequate and unclear, and expressed frustrations with the complexity of zoning rules and location of their boundaries. Based on this study, recommendations about the presentation, content, and placement of signage relative to access points, and information required by MPA users, is provided. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental education; In-situ signage; Interpretive/informative signage; Marine protected areas","communication; cost-benefit analysis; environmental education; environmental management; marine environment; marine park; recreational facility; signal; zoning policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925018515"

The objective of this study was to analyze the socioeconomic characteristics of visiting anglers and fishing guides working in the Cananéia-Iguape-Peruíbe Environmental Protected Area and their views on fisheries management. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews conducted between January 2009 and January 2010. We interviewed 278 anglers, who were predominantly male (93%) with a mean age of 47 years and from the state of São Paulo. The targeted species were snooks (Centropomus undecimales and Centropomus parallelus) and weakfishes (Cynoscion leiarchus and Cynoscion acoupa). Only half the anglers had the mandatory fishing license, and many of them lacked knowledge about catch quotas and minimum size requirements for specific species. The fishing guides (n = 80) were all male, with a mean age of 39 years and extensive experience. Most of the guides believe that the study area is somewhat degraded due to the removal of riparian vegetation, siltation, pollution, and especially the depletion of fish stocks. The opinions of the stakeholders (anglers and guides) converge on the high priority needs of the fishery and possible management actions regarding recreational fishing, such as improved fisheries enforcement (first in order of importance), proper training of fishing guides, zoning of fishing areas, and the definition of a maximum size limit. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","","Brazil; Iguape; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Biodiversity; Conservation; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Environmental Protected Area; Fisheries enforcement; Fisheries management; Recreational fishings; Riparian vegetation; Semi structured interviews; Socioeconomic characteristics; Southeastern Brazil; biodegradation; biodiversity; estuarine environment; fish; fishery management; protected area; recreational activity; socioeconomic status; stakeholder; stock assessment; Fisheries","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84875340287"

Our study incorporates short-run changes in prices and demands for palm oil and wood products, as well as the exchange rate, the real interest rate, land-use zoning, forest protection, the estimated opportunity cost of forested land, the quality of local governance, the poverty rate, population density, the availability of communications infrastructure, transport cost, local rainfall and terrain slope.The econometric results highlight the role of dynamic economic factors in forest clearing: significant roles for lagged changes in all the short-run economic variables-product prices, demands, the exchange rate and the real interest rate-as well as communications infrastructure, some types of commercial zoning, rainfall and terrain slope. We find no significance for the other variables, although our measure of protected-area status is too general for strong conclusions to be drawn about the empirical relationship between forest clearing and protection. It is also possible that the insignificance of transport cost in our results is due to collinearity with our proxy for communications cost, and/or the offsetting effects of transport cost on the direct profitability of forest clearing (negative) and the effectiveness of local forest regulation (positive).Our results strongly support a model of forest clearing as an investment that is highly sensitive to expectations about future forest product prices and demands, as well as changes in the cost of capital (indexed by the real interest rate), the relative cost of local inputs (indexed by the exchange rate), and the cost of land clearing (indexed by local precipitation). By implication, the opportunity cost of forested land fluctuates widely with changes in international markets and decisions by Indonesia's financial authorities about the exchange and interest rates. Our results suggest that forest conservation programs are unlikely to succeed if they ignore such powerful forces. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Deforestation; Developing country; Indonesia; Spatial analysis; Sustainable development","Indonesia; conservation management; cost-benefit analysis; database; decision making; deforestation; developing world; ecological economics; econometrics; exchange rate; forest clearance; forest product; interest rate; investment; land use change; panel data; population density; poverty; price dynamics; profitability; protected area; spatial analysis; sustainable development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84870548878"

Recently, besides increasing global protected coverage, there has been a growing demand to assess the adequacy of protected areas management. In this study, we assessed how the management of protected areas can deal with ecosystem services taking as example the Doñana and Sierra Nevada protected areas (Spain). For that aim we analyzed the protected area management plans, mapped seven ecosystem services, and assessed how they are affected by protected area zoning and land-use intensity. We found that although provisioning and cultural services are included in the management plans of the protected areas under a different terminology, regulating services are barely addressed. Ecosystem service delivery varies depending on several factors including the protection category of the protected areas (protection intensity), land-use intensity and geomorphological factors, among others. Therefore, we discuss that integrating ecosystem services in protected area management requires dealing with complexity, necessitating the establishment of specific goals for ecosystem service delivery, which include ecosystem service synergies and trade-offs. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","cultural landscapes; ecosystem service bundles; mapping; social–ecological system; trade-offs","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939876091"

However, these data have limitations that are not well understood. Furthermore, whether the application of socioeconomic data in planning actually reduces avoidable negative impacts on stakeholders is rarely evaluated. This study assessed impacts on commercial fishermen of the rezoning of the Moreton Bay Marine Park, in south eastern Queensland. Specifically, this study (1) compared estimates of opportunity costs of new no-take zones from before and after the rezoning was implemented, and (2) identified impacts of the new zoning scheme on fishing businesses and changes to working environment. Although estimates of aggregated opportunity costs before implementation matched those reported afterwards, these costs varied strongly between types of fisheries and individual fishing businesses. A large proportion of fishermen reported loss of fishing grounds. Some have found new grounds but reported that their travel times have increased and that the remaining open grounds are overcrowded. Fishermen have attempted to adapt to this new situation by changing the time spent fishing or diversifying into other fisheries, which required investing in new gear. The effectiveness of a structural adjustment package to compensate fishermen and minimize displacement of effort was limited by poor information on the number and use of commercial fishing licences and little understanding of the dependence of individual fishing businesses on particular fishing grounds. Ways of improving fisheries data for conservation planning and designing adjustment packages to more effectively mitigate impacts of MPAs on commercial fishermen are suggested. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Conservation planning; Fisherman; Marine protected areas; Opportunity cost; Social impacts; Spatial planning","Australia; Moreton Bay; Queensland; conservation planning; fishing; marine park; protected area; spatial planning; stakeholder; zoning system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84871819886"

In order to balance economic interests with the conservation of abyssal plain ecosystems, it is becoming increasingly important to develop a systematic approach to spatial management and zoning of the deep sea. Here, we describe an expert-driven systematic conservation planning process applied to inform science-based recommendations to the International Seabed Authority for a system of deep-sea marine protected areas (MPAs) to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem function in an abyssal Pacific region targeted for nodule mining (e.g. the Clarion-Clipperton fracture zone, CCZ). Our use of geospatial analysis and expert opinion in forming the recommendations allowed us to stratify the proposed network by biophysical gradients, maximize the number of biologically unique seamounts within each subregion, and minimize socioeconomic impacts. The resulting proposal for an MPA network (nine replicate 400 × 400 km MPAs) covers 24% (1 440 000 km2) of the total CCZ planning region and serves as example of swift and pre-emptive conservation planning across an unprecedented area in the deep sea. As pressure from resource extraction increases in the future, the scientific guiding principles outlined in this research can serve as a basis for collaborative international approaches to ocean management. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.","Abyssal plains; Deep sea; Geographic information system; Marine protected area network; Systematic conservation planning","Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Mining; Oceans and Seas; Clarion Fracture Zone; Clipperton Fracture Zone; Pacific Ocean; abyssal plains; deep sea; geographic information system; marine protected area network; systematic conservation planning; abyssal plain; biodiversity; coastal zone management; conservation planning; deep sea; ecosystem function; environmental economics; GIS; marine park; mining; socioeconomic impact; spatial analysis; abyssal plains; article; biodiversity; deep sea; environmental protection; geographic information system; marine protected area network; mining; sea; systematic conservation planning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899816396"

There is a legacy of undemocratic laws promulgated in the time of Leopold II that still govern land rights and the conservation of biodiversity. Numerous conflicting pressures are currently exerted on the DRC Government to lease more lands and create more protected areas. I argue that while conserving biological diversity is good, there is a need to reflect deeply on how to make the management of protected areas effective and reconciled with the needs expressed by communities. I also argue that preserving biodiversity is not and should not be equated with creating more new state-owned protected areas. There are other ways to conserve biodiversity, including privately protected areas, devolution of law enforcement to local communities, and downgrading some protected areas to IUCN Category VI, with proper zoning to reflect the reality of management. This is a complex process and involves strong political decisions and should be supported by a thorough assessment of the entire protected area network. I suggest that the key to success in preserving biodiversity in DRC is a proper land rights system and local law enforcement, which will make local communities allies rather than opponents to conservation. © 2018, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

As the empirical results show the AP prevented the Bavarian Alps from an overdevelopment of tourism infrastructure and provided important improvements for nature protection -without restricting tourism, its economic impact or recreational function.

A randomly distributed questionnaire indicated that 94% of fishers believed that without the MIMP, there would be overfishing, dynamite use, destroyed habitats, and few fish. Fishers were more positive about core zones (no-take fishery closures) than general use zones (areas allowing selective fishing) as a consequence of increases in fishing pressure. Those that reported increased catches and sizes of fish since the creation of the MIMP were more likely to agree with present zone locations and more positive in general about fisheries and conservation planning. Most thought that fish size and gear restrictions were preferable to permanent closures. Perceptions differed among communities and gear users. Community and gear type explained 46% of the variance in responses about the perception that fisheries and conservation are compatible goals. Somewhat surprisingly, these effects were more important than catch increases or involvement in MIMP-related activities. The differences in perception between communities may be partly attributed to different fishing histories. Multiple-use zoning provides a means to identify and resolve conflicts and achieve what are likely universal objectives for fisheries sustainability and conservation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Fisher knowledge; Fisher perception; Fisheries management; Fishery closures; Marine protected area; Small-scale fisheries","Mafia Island; Pwani; Tanzania; conservation management; fishery management; fishing community; overfishing; perception; protected area; resource management; small and medium-sized enterprise; sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84883460865"

Being inspired by this ultimate remark, the authors of the paper decided to analyse the evolution of the relationship between the Biosphere Reserves (BRs) and the Protected Areas (PAs), in terms of conceptual and operational approaches developed by both the respective scientific and practitioners’ communities. From being initially identified as sub-portions of pre-existing protected areas-as observed in the early designations dating back to the 1970s and 1980s of the last century - BRs have become larger, in terms of their total extensions, and multifunctional, in terms of their zoning drivers, including the PAs as only one portion of the entire designated territories. Paradoxically, the MaB Programme has never explicitly considered the “landscape” as a specific BR attribute (or nomination criteria), on the contrary to what has happened at UNESCO within the World Heritage Convention, where the concept of cultural landscape has become an official category of designated sites since 1992. The analysis concludes by observing how the relationship between BR and PAs may be easily transformed into a liaison dangereuse when a clear distinction of the respective primary functions and their territorial implications (the zoning) has not been applied. The two governance regimes can be easily confused with each other with clear difficulties of engineering appropriate management measures and risks of reducing their effectiveness. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Biosphere reserves; Governance; Landscape; Learning laboratories; Protected natural areas; Zoning","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945120277"

Being a rural settlement in the forest, the village was founded by the Polish refugees in 1842, with the approval of Ottoman Empire. Originally designed on a temporary basis, it turned into a permanent rural settlement when the immigrating population began to stay. This society reflected their own lifestyle and cultural structure in this village. Although tourism became prominent through the hunting activities in early 1900s, the traditional structure had been preserved for a long time, leaning on agriculture and livestock. Thanks to the infrastructural improvement activities conducted since 1970s, Polonez village began to attract more visitors. Following the inauguration of the Second Bosphorus Bridge in 1988, the interconnecting road allowed easier transportation to Polonez village, and tourism became even more prominent for the development of the village. Being recognized as a ""Natural Park"" in 1994 and a ""Natural Protected Area"" in 1995, the village has been able to focus on tourism activities by preserving its authentic nature for a long time, and it has become even more attractive in respect of touristic investments. Currently being an important centre of attraction for daily recreation activities as well as weekend tourism particularly due to its close proximity to Istanbul, Polonez village holds tourism on top of the list, considering its activity structure. 426 people live in the village in accordance with the 2013 data, it is inaccessible by public transport, and there are quite a range of guesthouses and hotels for lodging. Offering an opportunity to visit historical places, to taste local food, to use picnic areas, to take place in a range of touristic activities including nature sports, creative activities and festivals, Polonez village currently faces a change in its structure due to the amendment made on the zoning plan in November 2013, and the recent infrastructure activities conducted within its periphery. Although the village preserved its authentic structure for decades thanks to the consciousness actions of its people as well as the legal restriction, it is now feared that the draft zoning amendment may pave the way for housing, and its authentic characteristics will fade away, with negative effects on its sustainable development.","Istanbul; Metropolitan areas; Polonez village; Rural tourism; Sustainable development; Turkey","Istanbul [Istanbul (PRV)]; Istanbul [Turkey]; Turkey; metropolitan area; national park; peripheral region; rural area; sustainable development; tourism development; tourist attraction; village; zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945961221"

There are over one hundred thousand of these areas throughout the world and to date, their landscapes and biodiversity have constituted the main factor attracting visitors. Although these components have not lost their power to attract, many tourist destinations now highlight the relationship between nature and traditional culture. On one hand, the planning and management of natural areas have fundamentally been based on biophysical aspects; hence, their name. But, on the other, the socioeconomic perspective is of great importance and should be incorporated further into this management. The professional field of the sciences of ‘nature’, which so far has played a major role in these areas, along with the disciplines of social sciences and humanities, faces the challenge of integrating their analysis methods, which can be directly applied to an understanding of the dynamics of present-day tourism. This integration could consider protected areas and territories beyond their physical boundaries. Our team, with experience in the development of environmental analysis models applied to the zoning and subsequent declaration of these areas, has proposed a new procedure for evaluating carrying capacities and tourism potentialities, integrating environmental (landscape), anthropological (local society and visitors) and socioeconomic (living standard and quality of life of local population) perspectives. The research relates this kind of components through multivariate analyses, geo-referenced databases and questionnaires. The pathway of the model is landscape functioning (ecosystem) and its function for society (ecosystem services). © 2014 WIT Press.","Carrying capacity; Cultural landscape; Environmental planning; Landscape assessment; Local population preferences; Natural landscape; Protected area; Tourism; Visitors’ preferences","biodiversity; carrying capacity; cultural landscape; ecosystem service; ecotourism; environmental planning; landscape structure; protected area; tourist destination; zoning policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930364235"

While MPA zoning effects on particular target species are well reported, we are yet to fully resolve the various affects of spatial management on the structure of coral reef communities over decadal time scales. Here, we document mixed affects of MPA zoning on fish density, biomass and species richness over the 21 years since establishment of the Saba Marine Park (SMP). Although we found significantly greater biomass and species richness of reef-associated fishes within shallow habitats (5 meters depth) closed to fishing, this did not hold for deeper (15 m) habitats, and there was a widespread decline (38% decrease) in live hard coral cover and a 68% loss of carnivorous reef fishes across all zones of the SMP from the 1990s to 2008. Given the importance of live coral for the maintenance and replenishment of reef fishes, and the likely role of chronic disturbance in driving coral decline across the region, we explore how local spatial management can help protect coral reef ecosystems within the context of large-scale environmental pressures and disturbances outside the purview of local MPA management. © 2013 Noble et al.","","Animals; Caribbean Region; Conservation of Natural Resources; Coral Reefs; Ecosystem; Fishes; Anthozoa; Pisces; article; biomass; Central America; coral; coral reef; environmental change; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental protection; fish; habitat; marine protected area; population density; species richness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84872285297"

This review provides the most current summary from primary and grey literature on the biology and ecology of several coastal fishes of economic and ecological significance in south-east Australia; identifies key knowledge gaps which may impede the development of effective spatial management; and recommends future research directions and methods. Reviewed species are luderick (Girella tricuspidata), eastern rock blackfish (Girella elevata), yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis), tarwhine (Rhabdosargus sarba), snapper (Pagrus auratus), red morwong (Cheilodactylus fuscus) and eastern blue grouper (Achoerodus viridis). The species have a diverse range of life-histories and population traits, and selected parameters were well studied in several species, such as growth (blue groper, luderick, yellowfin bream, tarwhine, snapper), post-settlement movement (red morwong), and larval ecology (yellowfin bream). However, empirical data on levels of pre- and post-settlement connectivity and real-time movements are not available for most species, and this represents a significant gap for improved spatial management. A multidisciplinary approach incorporating a range of methods including acoustic tracking and telemetry, otolith chemistry, intergenerational markers, and biophysical modelling will provide a more comprehensive understanding of life history parameters, movement and connectivity at scales relevant to MPA planning and monitoring. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Marine Protected Areas; Population connectivity; Temperate fishes","Australia; Acanthopagrus australis; Achoerodus viridis; Cheilodactylus fuscus; Chrysophrys auratus; Epinephelinae; Girella elevata; Girella tricuspidata; Hyperoglyphe porosa; Pisces; Rhabdosargus sarba; coastal zone management; conservation management; ecological approach; environmental monitoring; fish; growth response; marine ecosystem; marine park; population dynamics; taxonomy","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887621035"

The effectiveness of Speed Restriction Zones (SRZs) as a management tool in this area was investigated during their second year of implementation by comparing dolphin usage and behaviour to adjacent Control Zones (CZs) of similar habitat. For this purpose, boat-based surveys and focal follows of dolphin groups were carried out in the zones between August 2008 and August 2009. Results showed that SRZs were more intensely used by dolphin-watching boats in summer. There was no change in dolphins' behaviour and group structure in the presence of dolphin-watching boats in SRZs when compared to dolphin groups within CZs in any season. Dolphin groups including calves used SRZs less during summer. The latter may indicate a shift in area utilisation for those groups during intense boat traffic by dolphin-watching operators. CZs were more important than SRZs as foraging grounds for dolphins in summer.

Historically there were two dominant forest management approaches in Nepal: protected areas and community-based forestry. These site-based management approaches were able to contribute to protect- ing endangered wildlife species, enhancing greenery, and improving livelihoods of forest-dependent communities. However, these approaches were not suitable when applied to increasing populations of wide-ranging mobile species because, outside of protected areas, conservation activities are in their infancy. To enhance the mobility of wildlife and conserve biodiversity, the Government of Nepal de- clared particular forest patches as Protected Forests to link the existing protected areas creating their network to manage the flora and fauna, while acknowledging the reliance of local communities on the forest resources. In order to create and maintain a balance between conservation and human needs for forest resources, a zoning-based Protected Forests management plan was devised, assigning specific forest patches for specific purposes. Since local community forest user groups were enjoying full benefits from their community forests, in the initial phase of the implementation of protected forest management, local communities may have to compromise on their consumption of forest products as some sections of the area are assigned for absolute protection. In the short run, they are compensated by support provided for income-generating activities; and, in the long ran, they can enjoy more benefits through ecotourism. Hence, the protected forest approach creates a win-win situation for both wildlife and local communities.","community forests; local community; Nepal; protected area; protected forest; wildlife corridors","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84905260169"

The governance of such a large and iconic area is complex due to the overlapping federal and state (Queensland) jurisdictions. Since 1975 this globally significant area has been protected by pioneering federal legislation which enabled the 'reasonable use' of natural resources to co-exist with conservation, thus introducing the concept of a multiple-use marine park. In 1981 the Great Barrier Reef was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Area. Today a federal multiple-use Marine Park covers 99% of the Great Barrier Reef Region and World Heritage Area, with the remaining areas under state jurisdiction. A close working partnership between the federal and state governments has evolved over 37 years and includes complementary legislation, joint field management and joint permits. In the face of increasing pressures, management of the Great Barrier Reef continues to be effective for a range of reasons, including a sound governance/legislative framework together with complementary federal/state legislation; integrated management with relevant federal and state agencies; and the application of ecosystem-based management principles both inside and outside the area of the marine park's jurisdiction.

As a consequence, the Project has implemented a stringent biodiversity management plan for the conservation area surrounding the mine footprint which also overlaps with the neighboring Torotorofotsy Ramsar site. As part of its biodiversity policy and to adhere to ""IFC Performance Standard 6"" on biodiversity conservation and sustainable natural resource management, the Project is committed to 1) avoiding species extinction, 2) minimizing impacts to natural resources, 3) realizing an actual net increase in the conservation of rare habitats, 4) assuring the viability of priority habitats by maintaining or increasing habitat connectivity, and 5) link Project actions in support of biodiversity with other regional biodiversity initiatives. To obtain these objectives, the Project has adopted a landscape approach to forest management that considers both the high level of biodiversity and the local population's dependence on natural resources as a means to sustain their livelihoods. As part of this approach, the Project is engaged in several activities including obtaining legal protection for a corridor linking the conservation area to the National protected areas system, providing support in updating the Ramsar site's management plan and creating a mine area forest zoning system that includes involving the local communities in forest management for sustainable resource use.

U.S. private land policy is generally implemented by local governments through comprehensive plans and zoning ordinances. While most cities have adopted these policies many non-metropolitan jurisdictions remain unzoned. In this study we investigated factors predicting zoning adoption in rural and exurban Michigan townships. Results from a logit model showed that likelihood of zoning adoption between 1998 and 2003 was higher for townships with more developed land, fewer conservative voters, higher household income, more zoned neighbors, and township-level planning rather than county-level planning. We quantified thresholds at which development levels correlated with zoning adoption. Overall, townships had greater than a 50% probability of adopting zoning when 9% or more of their land base had been developed, but this threshold was higher in townships with no planning (12%) and highest where planning was implemented at the county level (19%). In high-growth townships forestland was negatively correlated with zoning adoption. However, model results showed socioeconomic variables to be better predictors of zoning adoption than natural resource variables. These results highlight the importance that planning and zoning occur at the same level of government, and the importance of multiple policy options in jurisdictions unlikely to adopt zoning. Gaining insight into reasons for land-use policy adoption, or lack thereof, is important for achieving common planning goals, including preserving rural livelihoods, conserving forests and farmlands, and maintaining rural landscape characteristics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Land use; Local government; Planning; Policy adoption; Private land; Zoning","Conservation; Land Use; Probability; Michigan; United States; Conservation; Economics; Forestry; Land use; Logistic regression; Natural resources; Planning; Public policy; Rural areas; Gaining insights; Household income; Land conservation; Local government; Policy adoption; Private land; Rural landscapes; Rural livelihood; landscape planning; local government; private land; rural landscape; rural population; socioeconomic conditions; town planning; zonation; zoning policy; Zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84910019811"

Two related approaches may help accomplish this goal, either applied together or in isolation: (1) concentrating anthropogenic disturbance through zoning (with protected areas and intensive management); and (2) emulating natural disturbances. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of these two approaches, applied both in isolation and in combination, on the structure of the forest landscape. To do so, we use a spatially explicit landscape simulation model on a large fire-dominated landscape in eastern Canada. Specifically, we examine the effects of (1) increasing the maximum size of logged stands (cutblocks) to better emulate the full range of fire sizes in a fire-dominated landscape, (2) increasing protected areas, and (3) adding aggregated or dispersed intensive wood production areas to the landscape in addition to protected areas (triad management). We focus on maximizing the amount and minimizing the fragmentation of old-growth forest and on reducing road construction. Increasing maximum cutblock size and adding protected areas led to reduced road construction, while the latter also resulted in less fragmentation and more old growth. Although protected areas led to reduced harvest volume, the addition of an intensive production zone (triad management) counterbalanced this loss and resulted in more old growth than equivalent scenarios with protected areas but no intensive production zone. However, we found no differences between aggregated and dispersed intensive wood production. Our results imply that differences between unmanaged and managed landscapes can be reduced by concentrating logging efforts through a combination of protected areas and intensive wood production, and by creating some larger cutblocks. We conclude that the forest industry and regulators should therefore seek to increase protected areas through triad management and consider increasing maximum cutblock size. These results add to a growing body of literature indicating that intensive management on a small part of the landscape may be better than less intensive management spread out over a much larger part of the landscape, whether this is in the context of forestry, agriculture, or urban development. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Conservation; Cutblock size; Forest management; Old growth; Road effects; SELES; Triad zoning; Vermillion landscape model","Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Forestry; Human Activities; Models, Biological; Quebec; Trees; Canada; agricultural development; anthropogenic effect; economic activity; environmental disturbance; forest management; habitat fragmentation; habitat management; intensive agriculture; old-growth forest; protected area; road construction; urban development; article; biological model; Canada; economics; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; forestry; human activities; methodology; tree","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862976258"

Arguably social value of protected areas can be viewed as primarily recreational and aesthetic. Perhaps as a result, social value is often much less considered when compared to environmental and economic aspects when planning the establishment and management of protected areas in coastal locations. Understanding how society values these areas could therefore make a significant difference to optimising management direction and outcomes. Furthermore, understanding non-monetary values could help evaluate trade-offs which can be made between scenarios such as alternative development, management and conservation. Literature on social value touches on many topics including the emotional appreciation of wilderness and theory of visitor management. Ironically, in the future, climate change may raise social value at the coast given a public fascination with dramatic storms and sensational rapid change as a result of coastal processes. In order to identify social value, evaluate how it has been applied, and suggest better future integration, research focussing on selected coastal protected areas in England and Wales has taken an inductive grounded theory approach. A combination of practitioner and public interviews were undertaken to inform the design of a normative statement and model of social value. To understand social values at an operational level a detailed 'zoning chart' exercise in conjunction with an expert scoring system was applied to four case studies This work has resulted in validating social value criteria and has highlighted the complexities of measuring social value, particularly using a scoring system to rate the criteria. Tranquillity, for example, is typically subjective. Zoning charts proved to be a productive data collection tool, allowing visualisation of the criteria. All the data collection phases demonstrated that criteria in the 'spirituality and natural environment' theme provided the most social value to the public. Criteria in this theme include areas where it is possible to get away from other people in order to experience tranquillity, isolation and remoteness: experiences of views and open coastline: inspirational opportunities for art, poetry and photography: and an outdoor experience in a place where people want to be. © 2011 Coastal Education & Research Foundation.","ecosystem services; marine and coastal protected areas; marine protected areas; social value","England; Switzerland; United Kingdom; Walensee; Wales; climate change; coastal zone management; data acquisition; ecosystem service; nature conservation; protected area; recreational activity; recreational development; social development; zoning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879072831"

They are designed to maximize a certain biodiversity dimension such as coverage of species in the case of hotspots and complementarity, or composite properties of ecosystems in the case of wilderness. Most comparisons between approaches have ignored the multidimensionality of biodiversity. We analyze here the results of two species-based methodologies—hotspots and complementarity—and an ecosystem-based methodology—wilderness—at local scale. As zoning of protected areas can increase the effectiveness of conservation, we use the data employed for the management plan of the Peneda-Gerês National Park in Portugal. We compare the approaches against four criteria: species representativeness, wilderness coverage, coverage of important areas for megafauna, and for regulating ecosystem services. Our results suggest that species- and ecosystem-based approaches select significantly different areas at local scale. Our results also show that no approach covers well all biodiversity dimensions. Species-based approaches cover species distribution better, while the ecosystem-based approach favors wilderness, areas important for megafauna, and for ecosystem services. Management actions addressing different dimensions of biodiversity have a potential for contradictory effects, social conflict, and ecosystem services trade-offs, especially in the context of current European biodiversity policies. However, biodiversity is multidimensional, and management and zoning at local level should reflect this aspect. The consideration of both species- and ecosystem-based approaches at local scale is necessary to achieve a wider range of conservation goals. © 2015, The Author(s).","Area prioritization; Complementarity; Conservation management; Conservation planning; Protected areas; Wilderness; Zoning","Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Portugal; Wilderness; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Zoning; Complementarity; Conservation management; Conservation planning; Prioritization; Protected areas; Wilderness; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental protection; Portugal; procedures; wilderness; Ecosystems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937758876"

This chapter focuses on national or sub-national marine spatial planning that results in ocean zoning and corresponding management plans. Marine policies to control access to ocean areas and manage the use of marine resources have grown exponentially as coastal jurisdictions have expanded, and as the global community has taken increasing interest in those high seas areas that are beyond national jurisdictions. The Guidelines for Applying the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Protected Area Management Categories to MPA is thus a useful standard and a good basis for getting international agreement on terms and approaches for MPA planning.

This requires the adoption of mapping methods that can handle the relative nature of wildness, providing consistent evaluations for any context of analysis and supplying outputs that can be directly applied by park managers.To this purpose, a novel mapping approach is introduced that uses unsupervised classification to automatically cluster land parcels sharing similar wildness characteristics, as described by a set of spatial indicators.Wildness maps of the Dolomites UNESCO World Heritage Site (Italy) were generated by considering seven indicators of remoteness, perception and naturalness, and assigning each pixel of the study area to one of three classes (i.e. wild, semi wild, non wild), based on their values for the above-mentioned indicators.Results of our application showed a good degree of concordance with wildness maps obtained through Multi Criteria Evaluation (MCE) and emphasized how the class-based output may directly inform zoning activities and the identification of recreational opportunities. While lack of user's control is an obstacle to incorporating the views of multiple groups, as it is allowed by MCE-based methods, the proposed approach supports the idea that land characteristics should define the context of wilderness and drive management decisions. Further applications to a wide set of different contexts can help validate this approach. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","GIS; Recreation Opportunity Spectrum; Unsupervised classification; Wildness class; Zoning","Italy; Conservation; Environmental protection; Geographic information systems; Zoning; Management decisions; Methodological approach; Multi-criteria evaluation; Protected area management; Recreation opportunities; UNESCO world heritages; Unsupervised classification; Wildness class; decision making; dolomite; GIS; map; mapping; multicriteria analysis; park management; pixel; recreational development; UNESCO; unsupervised classification; wilderness area; World Heritage Site; Mapping","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84886553972"

With the aim to get important fishery information about this gastropod, adult Queen Conch density and frequency of reproductive activity were evaluated in Cabo Cruz, Cuba, during 2009-2010. Data from three seasons were obtained (rainy, dry and cold fronts periods) from three different areas: Farito, Guafe and Laguna. The highest density was observed in cold fronts season (468.5ind./ha) and the lowest occurred during the dry season (268.5ind./ha). The highest density was reported at Laguna (520.4ind./ha) and the lowest at Farito (290.9ind./ha). In total, 158 reproductive events were observed. The highest frequency was reported in rainy season (36%), followed by dry (9%) and cold fronts (5%) seasons. Reproductive behavior (mating and egg laying) was related to temperature and photoperiod. Reproductive activity was observed during the whole year, which suggests the existence of an important Queen Conch reserve in the Southeastern region of Cuba and an apparently self-sufficient population for recruitment. From our results we may conclude that, the population's sustainable exploitation is viable if the following management measures are observed: functional zoning within the area, rotation of fishing areas and a closed season. We recommend that the Laguna site should be protected as a reproduction zone and banned for fishing activities.","Caribbean sea; Eustrombus gigas; Fishery management; Protected areas; Reproduction evidence","Animals; Cuba; Female; Gastropoda; Male; Population Density; Reproduction; Seasons; animal; article; classification; Cuba; female; gastropod; male; physiology; population density; reproduction; season","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84877291189"

Within these parks, invasive species are second only to habitat destruction as the cause of biodiversity loss and ecological damage. So in January 2007 when a park volunteer discovered the invasive quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) in Lake Mead, which is part of the Lake Mead Recreation Area, the National Park Service (NPS) unit responsible for managing the recreation area was prepared for just such a discovery. It had an early detection program in place and had a clear operational mandate to do something about an invasion if it occurred. Upon finding mussels, the NPS quickly moved to access funding and the best available science to implement a response. After debating four options, the NPS focused on education and enforcing existing laws to prevent mussel spread. Despite this reasonable preparation and response, quagga mussels spread throughout the park, and quagga colonies soon began to appear throughout the southwestern United States. Given that efforts to stem the invasion were reasonable and rapid, why did they fail? While it is not known if any management strategy would have prevented or stopped the spread of mussels, the NPS was clearly constrained by an underlying commitment to manage the park by “zones.” This use of zoning as a management strategy concentrated visitation in the recreation area onto two lakes (Lakes Mead and Mohave), which in turn opened a pathway for invasion, guided management decisions, and likely contributed to the rapid spread of quagga mussels. Traditional policy efforts in conservation focus on what to conserve and where. However, very little information exists as to what policies actually work in the field. Failure to evaluate how policies translate into actions has led to the adoption of dogma that can be wrong and to an unwavering faith in the connection between a policy directive (e.g., ecotourism, bioprospecting, zoning) and a conservation outcome. Zoning is a common practice in park units worldwide. It reduces traditional stressors on other parts of a park by concentrating the human footprint in one area and reconciles competing mandates to protect nature and allow recreation. However, it also concentrates pathways for invasion by nonindigenous species. The risk of invasion by these species requires that the traditional management approach by zoning be examined and possibly be replaced by a more dynamic approach, particularly in susceptible parks like the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054458050"

To fight the decline of biological diversity, conservation science has broken ground with methods such as the operational model of systematic conservation planning (SCP), which focuses on design and on-the-ground implementation of conservation areas. The most commonly used method in SCP is reserve selection that focuses on the spatial design of reserve networks and their expansion. We expanded these methods by introducing another form of spatial allocation of conservation effort relevant for land-use zoning at the landscape scale that avoids negative ecological effects of human land use outside protected areas. We call our method inverse spatial conservation prioritization. It can be used to identify areas suitable for economic development while simultaneously limiting total ecological and environmental effects of that development at the landscape level by identifying areas with highest economic but lowest ecological value. Our method is not based on a priori targets, and as such it is applicable to cases where the effects of land use on, for example, individual species or ecosystem types are relatively small and would not lead to violation of regional or national conservation targets. We applied our method to land-use allocation to peat mining. Our method identified a combination of profitable production areas that provides the needed area for peat production while retaining most of the landscape-level ecological value of the ecosystem. The results of this inverse spatial conservation prioritization are being used in land-use zoning in the province of Central Finland. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.","Land-use planning; Land-use zoning; Site selection; Spatial optimization; Systematic conservation planning; Zonation software","Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Endangered Species; Finland; Soil; Finland; land-use planning; land-use zoning; optimización espacial; planificación de uso de suelo; planificación sistemática de la conservación; selección de sitios; site selection; software de zonificación; spatial optimization; systematic conservation planning; Zonation software; zonificación de uso de suelo; biodiversity; conservation management; conservation planning; economic development; ecosystem function; habitat conservation; habitat loss; implementation process; land use; mining; prioritization; protected area; site selection; software; spatial analysis; zonation; article; biodiversity; ecosystem; endangered species; environmental protection; Finland; land-use planning; land-use zoning; methodology; optimización espacial; planificación de uso de suelo; planificación sistemática de la conservación; selección de sitios; site selection; software de zonificación; soil; spatial optimization; systematic conservation planning; Zonation software; zonificación de uso de suelo","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897031853"

Because the area for conservation and resources for management are limited, both sites and actions need to be prioritized. Sandy beaches are poorly recognised as ecosystems, and thus are neither well managed nor regularly included in conservation initiatives, and are highly threatened. Therefore, we aim to refine an existing cumulative threat assessment (CTA) for beach ecosystems, the outputs of which can inform prioritization of beaches for conservation in reserves and/or various management objectives beyond reserves. We focus on the latter, using the CTA to derive a decision-support tool that aims to provide for use of sandy shores, whilst ensuring their ecological functioning is not compromised. The CTA depends on expert-based scores of threats to ecosystems; these were determined at the VIth International Sandy Beach Symposium (2012) for a baseline scenario under two criteria: functional impact and recovery time. Application of the CTA and decision-support tool is illustrated using the South African beaches. The baseline threat scores were adapted to suit the local context, and spatial trends in the cumulative impact of 15 threats were quantified. South African beaches are exposed to a broad range of cumulative pressure: overall it is relatively low, except where beaches are associated with areas of intensive coastal development. Based on the degree of permanent modification of the shore, and cumulative impact of all other stressors, the decision-support tool classifies beaches as: social-priority areas; ecological-priority areas; or social-ecological areas, each with specific management objectives. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Conservation; Cumulative impacts; Cumulative threat assessment; Integrated coastal zone management; Prioritization; Zoning","South Africa; Beaches; Coastal engineering; Coastal zones; Conservation; Decision support systems; Ecology; Regional planning; Zoning; Cumulative impacts; Decision support tools; Ecological functioning; Ecosystem-based management; Integrated coastal zone management; Management objectives; Prioritization; Threat assessment; beach; coastal development; coastal zone management; conservation management; decision support system; ecosystem management; integrated approach; marine ecosystem; marine park; prioritization; sand; vulnerability; Ecosystems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925172488"

Today there exists in Hawai'i a variety of spatial marine management strategies along a range of scales, with varying degrees of effectiveness. State-managed no-take areas make up less than 0.4% of nearshore waters, resulting in limited ecological and social benefits. There is increasing interest among communities and coastal stakeholders in integrating aspects of customary Hawaiian knowledge into contemporary co-management. A network of no-take reserves for aquarium fish on Hawai'i Island is a stakeholder-driven, adaptive management strategy that has been successful in achieving ecological objectives and economic benefits. A network of large-scale no-take areas for deepwater (100-400. m) bottomfishes suffered from a lack of adequate data during their initiation; however, better technology, more ecological data, and stakeholder input have resulted in improvements and the ecological benefits are becoming clear. Finally, the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (PMNM) is currently the single largest conservation area in the United States, and one of the largest in the world. It is considered an unqualified success and is managed under a new model of collaborative governance.

To assist landscape scale macro-zoning efforts, we employed a spatial allocation decision support tool called Marxan to develop a set of three scenarios of potential human and agricultural expansion for 2050. The results offer guidance to stakeholders and assist decision-makers in determining the most suitable land for inclusion in a proposed Rural Development Zone (RDZ), designed to accommodate the expansion of agricultural activities and subsequent deforestation while considering conservation priority areas. We used data describing current patterns of human activity, including historical primary forest loss, land cover suitability for agricultural activity, and presence of important wildlife connectivity zones and protected areas to identify locations where future agricultural expansion might be encouraged. We found that future agricultural demands can be met by expansion around historically intensive agricultural areas in the eastern portion of MLW without significantly compromising conservation priority areas. Wildlife connectivity zones are most vulnerable to future agricultural expansion because of their proximity to current agricultural activity. Our results demonstrate the need to prioritize conservation action in these areas and illustrate how competing needs might be balanced in planning for both agricultural expansion and terrestrial biological conservation in this landscape. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Congo basin; Conservation planning; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Land use planning; Marxan","Democratic Republic Congo; comparative study; conservation management; conservation planning; data set; decision making; land use planning; landscape; participatory approach; protected area; rural development; stakeholder","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878940324"

Additionally, most theory on systematic spatial conservation planning is focused on the design of single zone reserves. The present study, focused in Wales (UK), uses the systematic conservation software Marxan with Zones to quantify the benefits of integrating extractive and non-extractive interests in the planning process of MPAs and assesses whether the impacts on affected users differs between single vs. multiple zones MPAs. Results indicate that MPAs designed with consideration of non-extractive interests reduced the potential economic impacts on this sector by approximately 50% more than MPAs designed without that consideration, without extra cost to the extractive sector.

The park (188.6 km 2), covers various ecosystems such as coastal lagoons, marine waters and xerophytic vegetation, it is visited by up to 260,000 people visit per year. A GIS, using a base map compiled from 1:25,000 maps was developed. Natural cover was mapped from LANDSAT VII TM images, orthophotomaps and aerial photographs. Spatial use data was collected by field GPS location of any use inside the park during 2 years. Thematic vector maps for each land cover, zoning area, and observed use were created. Maps of zoning and uses were overlapped and new maps for each use-zoning crossing were created. The park contain nine different zoning areas wherein 28 different uses were identified, 18 of them were direct consumptive and non-consumptive uses, occurring on 54% of the park. Tourism transit areas were the most used zones. More than 5,000 people use the park during a high season day. Superimposition of zoning maps with actual use data produced 13 uses taking place in not allowed areas (46% of park area). Most common prohibited use was commercial net fishing, occurring in nearly 40% of the park area. Therefore, identifying human use conflicts and its geographical distribution is a key issue to improve Management Plans as well as identifying hot sites. The GPS-GIS methodology presented here allows Park Rangers to select those areas which could benefit from enhanced supervision with the limited budget available. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Actual uses; GPS-GIS; La Restinga National Park; Protected areas; Use zoning","La Restinga Lagoon; Margarita Island; Nueva Esparta; Venezuela; aerial photograph; biodiversity; environmental management; GIS; GPS; Landsat thematic mapper; nature conservation; orthophoto; protected area; spatial data; thematic mapping","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857690397"

However, spatial prioritization methods that can accommodate multiple zones are poorly understood in theory and application. It is typically assumed that management regulations across zones have differential levels of effectiveness (""zone effectiveness"") for biodiversity protection, but the influence of zone effectiveness on achieving conservation targets has not yet been explored. Here, we consider the zone effectiveness of three zones: permanent closure, partial protection, and open, for planning for the protection of five different marine habitats in the Vatu-i-Ra Seascape, Fiji. We explore the impact of differential zone effectiveness on the location and costs of conservation priorities. We assume that permanent closure zones are fully effective at protecting all habitats, open zones do not contribute towards the conservation targets and partial protection zones lie between these two extremes. We use four different estimates for zone effectiveness and three different estimates for zone cost of the partial protection zone. To enhance the practical utility of the approach, we also explore how much of each traditional fishing ground can remain open for fishing while still achieving conservation targets. Our results show that all of the high priority areas for permanent closure zones would not be a high priority when the zone effectiveness of the partial protection zone is equal to that of permanent closure zones. When differential zone effectiveness and costs are considered, the resulting marine protected area network consequently increases in size, with more area allocated to permanent closure zones to meet conservation targets. By distributing the loss of fishing opportunity equitably among local communities, we find that 84-88% of each traditional fishing ground can be left open while still meeting conservation targets. Finally, we summarize the steps for developing marine zoning that accounts for zone effectiveness. © 2013 Makino et al.","","Animals; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fiji; Fisheries; Fishes; Geography; Humans; Marine Biology; Population Dynamics; Reproducibility of Results; article; biodiversity; conservation biology; cost; environmental parameters; environmental planning; environmental protection; Fiji; fishing; geographic distribution; habitat; marine environment; zone effectiveness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84892593270"

In particular, spatial zoning for various types of MPA designs could accommodate several demands for ecological conservation while minimizing socioeconomic impact. Most spatial zoning approaches are formulated as nonlinear Multi-Objective Decision-Making (MODM) models, which are solved using stochastic search algorithms, such as the popular Marxan with Zones. Due to the stochastic nature of these algorithms, the final MPA design is the composite result of several modeling experiments, and the solution is often suboptimal. For the current study, two MODM models were developed based on Multi-Objective Integer Linear Programming (MOILP) for MPA spatial zoning. The proposed models are referred to as a buffer cells model (BCM) and an external border cells model (EBCM). BCM allocates two types of cells to an MPA zone, covering core and buffer cells. The EBCM uses external border cells instead of buffer cells. Both models can minimize the cost incurred by MPA implementation while simultaneously satisfying different conservation targets. The solutions found are globally optimal. MPA designs from the BCM, EBCM, and Marxan with Zones are compared by displaying their spatial distributions. The results present the general characteristics of the BCM and EBCM and demonstrate how both models may have certain advantages over the Marxan with Zones method and can thus be considered as good alternatives for MPA spatial zoning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","","Cells; Conservation; Cytology; Decision making; Environmental protection; Integer programming; Stochastic systems; Zoning; Conservation targets; Ecological conservation; Efficient planning; Integer Linear Programming; Marine protected area; Multi objective decision making; Socio-economic impacts; Stochastic search algorithms; algorithm; decision making; marine park; multiobjective programming; reserve design; spatial distribution; spatial planning; Stochastic models","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925219772"

The Antarctic protected area network has developed largely without any clear strategy, despite scientific attempts to promote protection of representative habitats. Many Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) Management Plans do not state clearly if conservation or science is the priority objective. This is problematic as science and conservation may have conflicting management requirements, i.e. visitation may benefit science, but harm conservation values. We examined recent estimated mean annual levels of visitation to ASPAs. On average, ASPAs protecting scientific research interests were visited twice as often as ASPAs conserving Antarctic habitat and biological communities. However, ASPAs protecting both science and conserving habitat were visited three times as often as ASPAs conserving habitat alone. Examination of visitation data showed that the proportion of visitors entering ASPAs for science, environmental management and/or education and tourism purposes, did not reflect the primary reason for designation, i.e. for science and/or conservation. One third of APSAs designated since the Environmental Protocol entered into force (1998) did not describe clearly the main reason for designation. Policy makers should consider (i) for all Management Plans stating unambiguously the reason an area has ASPA designation, e.g. either to protect habitat/environmental values or scientific research, in accordance with adopted guidance, (ii) designating new protected areas where visitation is kept to an absolute minimum to ensure the long-term conservation of Antarctic species and habitats without local human impacts (possibly located far from areas of human activity), and (iii) encouraging the use of zoning in ASPAs to help facilitate the current and future requirements of different scientific disciplines. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Conservation; Environmental management; Human impact; Polar; Protected area; Visitation","Antarctica; article; education; environmental management; environmental protection; habitat; priority journal; science; tourism","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84877884035"

This region came under the supervision of the Department of Environment on January 5, 2000. In the present research, aerial and satellite images, direct observations, sample-collecting and territorial photographs of the general appearance of the region have been used. The main objective of the present research is the zoning of sylvan habitats of the Siahroud protected zone with an emphasis on eradicating its residential pattern and non-sylvan applications using the GIS and RS technologies. In the first step, the contour lines and height points of the 1:25000 maps of the cartographic center has been used in order to prepare the hypsometric maps and identify the slope and slope inclination of Siahroud protected zone. The results show that the minimum height of the zone is 176 meters and its maximum is 2714 meters above the sea level. The highest level of elevated stories belong to the 1200 -1800 meters class which constituted 45.44 percent of the whole region. The most extensive area of the slope stories belongs to the 30 - 65 class which comprises some 47.34 percent of the whole region. The inclinations of the western and southern slopes are 29.2 and 26.89 percent respectively and have involved the highest amount of the slope inclination stories level. In the next step, the 2007 IRS satellite image of Roudbar's Siahroud zone has been selected in the ERDAS software. In introducing the classes (stories), satellite images, topographic data and Google Earth images were used in the scale of 1:25000. It is notewor-thy that in introducing the classes which had unidentified or indistinct land uses, the longitude and lati-tude were specified, the land was examined through field search, the latitude and longitude were specified using GPS and its use was made out. The algorithm used in the observed classification was Maximum Likelihood Classification. The results produced showed that the total area of the forest in the region has been 13787.79 hectares which comprises 48.73 percent of the whole region. 195.25 hectares (0.69 percent) was dedicated to garden, 132.95 hectares (0.47 percent) to garden and agronomy, 2050.42 hectares (7.25 percent) to residential complexes, 1051.17 hectares (3.72 percent) to arid lands and 11072.16 hectares (39.14 percent) to pasturage. The residential area includes one city (Barehsar) and 54 villages which with an area of 2050.42 hectares comprise some 7.25 percent of the whole region.

Decision support tools can be applied to provide advice on potential zoning configurations. However, few studies used decision support tools to systematically determine good locations for different types of zones that accommodate multiple and often conflicting objectives. Previous studies have mostly used scores to integrate multiple objectives and identify different zoning configurations or explored priority areas for each zone separately. Neither of these approaches ensure that solutions meet both biodiversity and human-use objectives. Nor do they deal with the fact that in zoning plans the whole is not the same as the sum of the parts, the importance of a site depends on how the rest of the sites are managed. The aim of this study was to identify different zoning configurations for the Raja Ampat MPA network in Eastern Indonesia that address biodiversity, sustainable fisheries and community resource access objectives. Identifying zoning configurations is particularly difficult here given the importance of protecting high biodiversity reefs and other conservation values, and the high reliance of local communities on their marine resources. Potential areas for no-take zones were identified that have a small and equitable impact across the fishing grounds of different fishing communities whilst ensuring each community has access to a 'sustainable fishing zone'. Access to fishing grounds for each community is complicated due to marine tenure restricting where individuals can fish and reliance on traditional types of fishing vessels that restrict long distance travel. This approach for zoning was compared to three others. The first focused on identifying areas only for the no-take zone, a traditional systematic planning approach, and the second on both zones without explicitly accounting for the issue of resource access for each community. The solutions unfairly impacted particular communities. Finally, it is demonstrated how a pre-existing zoning proposal, driven by negotiation can be integrated into systematic planning. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Coral Triangle; Decision support tool; Fisheries; Marxan","Indonesia; Indonesia; New Guinea; Raja Ampat Islands; West Papua; Anthozoa; Raja; biodiversity; comparative study; coral reef; decision support system; environmental planning; fishery management; marine park; nature conservation; sustainability; zoning policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84876015634"

The UN has made a global appeal for all countries to mitigate their impact on the environment. Marine environmental protection is one of the most critical and urgent issues in the world and many countries have commenced establishing marine protected areas (MPAs) by implementing ecosystem-based management (EBM) concepts. MPA planning has been considered one of the simplest and most effective methods to protect marine environments. Taiwan has recently developed policies that have focused on its marine environment, and there are plans to increase the size of Taiwan[U+05F3]s MPAs to 20% of its total ocean territory by 2020, thereby achieving a sustainable ocean. To achieve this goal, the government must address specific difficulties associated with the location of MPAs and relevant zoning strategies. This study establishes MPA protection principles and a zoning framework for MPAs in Taiwan by using Gueishan Island in Yilan County as a case study site to examine specific zoning strategies. The protection of 3 objectives (hydrothermal vents, cetacean, and fisheries resources) is discussed in this paper. Multi-criteria spatial analysis and a geographic information system are applied to identify the most crucial area to protect. To understand the stakeholders[U+05F3] opinions and concerns regarding the proposed zoning framework, this research conducted in-depth interviews with experts and stakeholders. MPAs zoning strategies are formulated at the conclusion of this study that could assist in protecting critical marine resources and avoiding conflicts among various usages of the marine area. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Ecosystem-based management; Geographic information system; Marine protected area (MPA); Marine spatial planning; Multi-criteria spatial analysis","China; Heilongjiang; Taiwan; Yilan; biodiversity; GIS; marine park; marine resource; multicriteria analysis; protected area; spatial analysis; spatial planning; zoning system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896530665"

Weh Island, Sabang, Indonesia, has two MPAs: Weh Island Marine Recreational Park (WMRP) and Weh Island Marine Protected Area (WMPA). The WMRP was established by the Government of Indonesia in 1982 and is managed by the Natural Resources Conservation Agency in the Ministry of Forestry. The other, WMPA, was established in 2010 and is managed by the Government of Sabang[U+05F3]s Marine Affairs and Fisheries Agency. First, this study reviews the regulations of the two MPAs. There are 17 regulations related to the management of the two MPAs. WMRP is governed centrally based on Law No. 32, and the WMPA has shifted to a bottom-up system based on Fisheries Law No. 31. In addition, the customary management system called Panglima Laot, which literally translates to ""Sea Commander"" functions for local residents. Second, 185 questionnaires were completed by government offices, non-governmental organizations, fishermen, and marine tourism operators from January to September 2013. The survey showed all respondents support the development of MPAs. More respondents in the WMPA are familiar with the MPA and received benefits from MPAs. Fishermen of the WMRP considered their participation to be low and have lower trust in the government. The participants in the WMRP considered that ""support of all stakeholders[U+05F3] awareness of the marine environment"" is most important.

Multibeam sonar-derived bathymetry, seabed slope, and acoustic reflectance (backscatter) were combined using supervised classification methods and GIS with ground-truthed benthic sampling in order to derive maps of the substrates and main benthic habitats. Six acoustically distinct substrate types were identified in the fjord, and three additional substrate types without a unique acoustic signature were recognized. Ordination by multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity generalized these to four acoustically distinct habitat types. Greatest within-habitat (alpha) diversity was found in the coralline-algae encrusted gravel habitat. Greatest between-habitat (beta) diversity was found in the management Zones 1 and 2, which have the highest level of protection.

Marine spatial planning has been widely hailed as a means of improving ocean governance through holistic ecosystem-based planning. However, that concept arose without reference to climate change, and hence it does not automatically account for the dynamic alterations in marine ecosystems that climate change is bringing. This Article attempts to adapt marine spatial planning to climate change adaptation. In so doing, it explores three main topics. First, it examines how established marine protected areas can aid climate change adaptation. Second, it looks at how nations have incorporated climate change considerations into marine spatial planning to increase marine ecosystem resilience, focusing on the international leader in marine spatial planning: Australia. Finally, the Article explores how marine spatial planning could become flexible enough to adapt to the changes that climate change will bring to the world's oceans, focusing on anticipatory zoning. Governments, of course, can establish marine zoning governance regimes in anticipation of climate change impacts, as has already occurred in the Arctic. However, drawing on work by Josh Eagle, Barton H. Thompson, and James Sanchirico, this Article argues that governments could also combine anticipatory zoning and comprehensively regulated marine use rights bidding regimes to encourage potential future private users to make informed bets about the future productivity value of different parts of the ocean, potentially improving both our ability to anticipate climate change impacts on particular marine environments and the ocean governance regimes for climatesensitive areas.","","Australia; climate change; environmental policy; governance approach; marine ecosystem; marine policy; spatial planning; twenty first century; zoning policy","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84882260123"

Fishers' spatial preferences should be considered during the site selection process, but biodiversity considerations are generally the primary focus. The Protected Area Suitability Index (PASI) is a fuzzy logic spatial planning tool that combines human preferences and conservation criteria to assess the suitability of marine sites for being protected from fishing and other extractive use. We apply the PASI in zoning a marine sanctuary in Sabah, Malaysia, with the objectives of (i) assessing the PASI's ability to capture fishers' spatial preferences; and (ii) comparing the nuances of community based and fuzzy logic approaches in spatial planning. There was overlap in sites chosen for protection by both approaches, and multi-dimensional scaling results suggest that the PASI captures fishers' preferences. Community consultations enable direct integration of local knowledge to fill gaps in scientific knowledge, but can be time consuming and expensive. The PASI is an alternative to data and labour intensive conservation planning tools that are currently available, and can be particularly useful for zoning marine protected areas in data poor developing countries where conservation requires quick action. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Community consultation; Fishers' spatial preferences; Fuzzy logic; Marine protected area zoning; Marine spatial management; Sabah, Malaysia","East Malaysia; Malaysia; Sabah; biodiversity; conservation planning; data acquisition; fishery management; fuzzy mathematics; protected area; spatial planning; zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84885032373"

Climate change makes the consideration of the dynamics of ecological processes in the design of marine protected areas critical. We analyzed sea-surface temperature (SST) trends and variability in Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) for 25 years and formulated and tested whether three sets of notional conservation objectives were met to illustrate the potential for planning to address climate change. Given mixed and limited evidence that no-take areas increase resilience to disturbances such as anomalously high temperatures (i.e., temperatures ≥1 °C above weekly mean temperature), our conservation objectives focused on areas less likely to be affected by such events at extents ranging from the entire Great Barrier Reef to the system of no-take zones and individual no-take zones. The objective sets were (1) at least 50% of temperature refugia (i.e., pixels that had high-temperature anomalies <5% or <7% of the time) within no-take zones, (2) maximum occurrence of high-temperature anomalies is <10%,< 20%, or <30% of total no-take area 90% of the time, and (3) coverage of any single no-take zone by high-temperature anomalies occurs <5% or <10% of the time. We used satellite imagery from 1985-2009 to measure SST to determine high-temperature anomalies. SSTs in the Great Barrier Reef increased significantly in some regions, and some of the conservation objectives were met by the park's current zoning plan. Dialogue between conservation scientists and managers is needed to develop appropriate conservation objectives under climate change and strategies to meet them. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.","Climate change; Coral reefs; Marine conservation; Marine protected areas; Marine reserves; SST","Australia; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Coral Reefs; Oceans and Seas; Temperature; Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Pacific Ocean; Queensland; Anthozoa; adaptive management; climate change; conservation management; conservation planning; coral reef; ecosystem resilience; environmental disturbance; marine ecosystem; marine park; refugium; reserve design; satellite imagery; sea surface temperature; temperature anomaly; zoning policy; article; Australia; climate change; coral reef; environmental protection; evaluation; methodology; sea; temperature","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865965233"

Their general approval is demonstrated by the fact that the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity have set the target that 10 per cent of the world’s oceans should be protected (Convention on Biological Diversity, 2010), even though currently no more than approximately 1 percent are protected (Spalding et al., 2010). In the literature the effectiveness and the possibilities of MPAs are debated. Some authors seem to consider MPAs as a panacea (e.g., Bohnsack, 1993); others are more sceptical about the possibilities (e.g., Hannesson, 1998; Anderson, 2002). This divergence is partly caused by the different meanings that people attach to ‘MPA’, especially to the term ‘protected’ (Jones, 2001). If ‘protected’ only means ‘protected from fishing’ and the goal is to protect or improve fisheries, then MPAs are no-take zones. If they are to be protected from all human uses, then the term ‘marine reserve’ might be more appropriate. Sometimes ‘protected’ is interpreted to mean ‘protected from some uses but not from others’; in that case MPAs are essentially a zoning tool. In this chapter we will consider MPAs as areas that are protected from extractive uses and affect multiple ecosystem services, in our case food production (fisheries) and cultural and option use services (species protection). © Paulo A.L.D.

At the same time policy makers and practitioners recognize the value of local knowledge in planning and management practices, including for the planning and management of conservation areas. Mindful of this dilemma geographers and researchers in allied fields such as applied anthropology have tested participatory and inclusive mapping techniques across a variety of cultural contexts over the last several decades. This article evaluates the outcomes of a participatory conservation zoning exercise undertaken in a mineral extraction zone-the Cordillera Huayhuash-in the Andes of Central Peru and contributes a case study to this body of work. The principal method used was the construction of a manual 'GIS' upon which local communities could draw their zoning vision as an overlay on transparent acetate. The evaluation of the work focuses on the governance outcomes from the process rather than the map products that were drawn. The findings confirm that such processes are rife with the dilemmas identified in prior research, yet the zoning project also helped 'bridge' the great divide between the state and civil society by building trust through dialog. The findings also indicate that the chosen approach can be used as a ground truthing tool to identify accuracy and completeness problems in the cadastral database maintained by the government of Peru. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Conservation zoning; Cordillera Huayhuash; Mining; Participatory mapping; Peru; Private conservation","Andes; Cordillera Huayhuash; Cordillera Occidental [Peru]; Peru; civil society; indigenous population; local participation; mapping; mining; participatory approach; protected area; traditional knowledge; zoning policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955740921"

When assessing the ecological, economic, and social-cultural impacts of protection, the dynamics of fisheries and fishers reallocation within and around multiple-use MPAs should be analyzed. Despite this, few studies incorporate the baseline information of fisheries distribution, therefore compromising an understanding of fishers' preferences, choices and constrains before losing fishing grounds through the establishment of zoning and protection measures. To fulfil this gap, here we assess the spatial and seasonal fishers' preferences from local artisanal fisheries (nets, traps, jigs and longlines) before the implementation of a MPA management plan (the Arrábida Marine Park, Portugal). Zero inflated modelling, hotspot analysis, vessels distribution range and site fidelity statistics showed that the main drivers of fishing effort allocation are the placement of preferred fishing grounds which are likely related to the distribution of target species and associated habitats. Proximity to port, weather conditions and distance to coast are also important factors influencing, in different ways, these artisanal fisheries. Our findings highlight the complex dynamics of the distribution of artisanal fisheries operating multiple-gears and targeting multiple-species and are likely transferable to many coastal multiple-use MPAs where no baseline data exist. Moreover, the variety of responses and preferences found between gears and fishers before the establishment of zoning are important to understand the dynamics of local fisheries, to contribute to an ecosystem-based management and to improve both conservation and fisheries management decisions. Our study is one of the few characterizing fisheries dynamics and fishers' preferences before protection measures are implemented providing important lessons to the management of coastal fisheries where artisanal fisheries prevail. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Artisanal fisheries; Baseline information; Fishing effort allocation; Marine protected areas; Spatial modelling","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84888193735"

Therefore, the red line has played an important role in the field of ecological protection, not only optimizing ecological security but also relating resource protection to economic development. Most importantly, it is a bottom line for China’s construction of an ecologically sustainable civilization. In the initial stages, ecological red line protection meant a strictly administered strategic border for the maintenance of national and regional ecological security and economic and social sustainable development. The early development of natural resource conservation concepts and policy saw similar methods and practices at home and abroad. Foreign countries commonly use national park systems, special protection areas (SPAs), special areas of conservation, Natura 2000, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature-Global Protected Areas to protect ecological spaces. China has generally used nature reserves, country parks, basic ecological control lines, and national zoning of ecological and subjective functions to achieve the same ends. Among these, the extensively used basic ecological control line is regarded as the prototype for the ecological red line. After the proposal of the red line concept, Jiangsu Province was the first to officially implement the concept in China. In this year's annual Local NPC and CPPCC, the ecological red line has been incorporated into the work reports of many provincial governments, showing that drawing the red line has entered the strategic promotion phase. With the progress study, the concept of the ecological red line has been extended to a comprehensive system covering three aspects:space, resources, and quality of environment. Based on relevant literature and the relationships between production, life, and ecological space, the foundation of its theory extensions comes from the theory of ecological risk source of regional development established by Ren Jingming et al., including the ecological footprint, resource consumption and pollution emissions accumulated three types. The ecological red line is extending into ecological space, resource consumption, and environmental protection, and further proposes to control requirements, including the warning to the top line, the regulation to the midline, and the maintenance of the bottom line. Meanwhile, the system of ecological red lines is implemented based on a case study of the Ningde region. The results showed that the total area enclosed within an ecological red line is 4258.03 km2, accounting for 31.65% of the total land area of Ningde. The red line of resource consumption and environmental protection is the concrete implementation of control requirements, and formed red indicators. Finally, a supporting safeguard mechanism will be established from three aspects (regulations, systems, and markets) in order to provide a reference for further improvements of the red line system. © 2015 Ecological Society of China.

A chronology of events describes how the development and acceptance of an ecosystems approach policy began to converge and coincide with the spread and development of Integrated Coastal Zone Management. Those organizations that gave representation to the conservation ethic became internationally recognized as surrogate natural resource 'users', the interests of which possessed commonality with all stakeholder interests in general. The tenants of conservation policy were therefore largely employed to decide the merits of disputes over ocean and coastal resources. In the 1990s, scientists created a forum to debate, better define, and institutionalize a sound basis for ecosystem management theory and practice. Protocols were developed that embedded science in living and natural resources planning and management. These protocols were shaped and adopted to serve an evermore contemporary Integrated Coastal Zone Management model. Improvements in methodology include the use of adaptive management, ecological modeling and monitoring, appropriate temporal and spatial scales, salient indicators, and stakeholder participation. This contemporary approach is dependent upon recognizing the benefits inherent in utilizing instruments capable of managing resources on a holistic level. Bioregional planning and zoning accommodate the successful management of resources on this level. It is a direct outcome of the convergence of Integrated Coastal Zone Management and the ecosystems approach. Bioregional zoning schemes are capable of traversing the private property and common property doctrines that define the respective terrestrial and aquatic environments of the coastal zone.

This NP is particularly suited to such an investigation for a number of reasons: it presents a very complex landscape and a wide altitude range; it is characterized by strong human influence and different land management types; some of the inhabitants within the NP belong to the Italian-, others to the German-speaking ethnic group and the NP covers three Italian regions, each with its own past and cultural history. We identified determinants of influence on the basis of a representative survey. Explorative analyses with discriminant analyses as classification method revealed a subordinated role for achieving acceptance of both the attitude towards nature and the work of the National Park Administration (NPA). According to our findings, perceptions in the local population are formed in a three-step-process starting with environmental education to identifying and answering the social needs of the residents to acknowledging personal needs by minimizing disadvantages for individuals. All in all, the results show that a survey of the population carried out in the presented way can make a major contribution to focusing the work of the NPA and to minimizing activities in 'fruitless tasks'.","Key factors; Local population; Nature protection; Perception; Zoning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84871953818"

Literature on ocean zoning design methods points out the need for analytical tools that guarantee stakeholder involvement and that address the unique spatial characteristics of the sea, especially under multiple jurisdictions. I illustrate the use of a method of spatial multi-criteria analysis (MCA) that combines data of the land and ocean environment with stakeholder preferences to identify areas most suitable for varying levels of protective zoning. To solicit preferences, I apply social science survey techniques at an early stage in the process. I synthesize the resulting preferences with physical data using a geographical information system. This comprehensive approach addresses some of the challenges of designing zoning for a cross-border, multi-jurisdictional MPA such as varying levels of information between countries, limited cooperation between managers and scientists, differing statutory regimes, and difficulties bringing stakeholders together to solicit their opinions. As a case study, I developed a zoning proposal for the Red Sea Marine Peace Park (RSMPP), a proposed MPA to be jointly managed by Jordan and Israel in the northern Gulf of Aqaba. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Of the 155 species regularly recorded in South African estuaries, only 32 (21%) are completely dependent on these systems, but this figure increases to 103 species (66%) if partially dependent taxa are included in the analysis. The conservation of fishes in estuaries on the subcontinent is threatened by a number of factors, including habitat degradation, disruption of essential ecological processes, hydrological manipulations, environmental pollution, overexploitation due to fishing activities and, more recently, climate change and the effects of introduced aquatic animals. Although major threats to fishes are usually linked to environmental degradation, there is increasing evidence that the stocks of certain fish species are overexploited or collapsed. Fish conservation and fisheries management does not depend on the implementation of a single action, but rather the co-ordination of a detailed plan, often in a multidisciplinary context. Some examples of innovative means of contributing to estuarine fish conservation in a South African context include the determination and implementation of the ecological freshwater requirements for estuaries, the zoning of estuaries for different uses and the recognition that the maintenance of ecological processes are vital to aquatic ecosystem health. Apart from the designation of protected areas, the main direct means of conserving fish species and stocks include habitat conservation, controls over fishing methods, effort, efficiency and seasonality, pollution control and the prevention of artificial manipulation of estuary mouths. Since becoming a democracy in 1994, environmental legislation, policy and institutional arrangements in South Africa have undergone some major changes, which, if fully implemented, will be very positive for fish conservation in estuaries on the subcontinent. © 2010 The Authors.

Feedback about the implementation of this new policy suggests that agriculture continues to drive deforestation. This article explores farmers' household livelihood strategies and land use changes in response to changing forest access rules arising from community-based land management. Based on studying in-depth surveys and participatory mapping in the eastern rain forest highlands, we outline patterns in farmers' responses, exploring the relationship between sociodemographic factors, livelihood strategies, and patterns of land use. Our findings suggest that heterogeneity in farmers' adaptation capacities is closely related to different land use patterns. Furthermore, both conservation and agricultural sustainability have suffered from unintended impacts: an increase of forest clearing, intensificationin cultivated area, and an impoverishment of the poorest households. These detailed reviews of household adaptation processes suggest that the zoning-based management scheme would benefit from incorporating a more detailed farm level land use approach.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are being used increasingly to manage and protect marine resources. Most studies of MPAs have focused on fish. In this study, the influence of MPA protection on coral reef benthic organisms on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) was investigated. In addition, the interaction between protection and natural disturbance history was examined. 2. Differences in benthic cover inside and outside MPAs were assessed at 15 pairs of Protected and General Use reefs on the GBR using annual monitoring data from the Australian Institute of Marine Science's Long-Term Monitoring Programme (LTMP). At each reef, benthic cover was determined using a benthic video survey at three sites, with each site consisting of five 50m transect lines separated by at least 250m running parallel to the reef crest at 6-9m depth. 3. Benthic cover was related to both protection status and disturbance history, but natural perturbations exerted a stronger influence on benthic cover than did protection status. The influence of natural perturbation was most noticeable for hard coral. 4. Most reefs where no natural disturbance events had occurred ('undisturbed reefs') had higher hard coral cover and lower soft coral cover than General Use reefs. While the high levels of hard coral on Protected reefs may be a result of protection status, it might also have resulted from selection bias that occurred during the initial zoning of the Great Barrier ReefMarine Park (i.e. managers may have given protection status to reefs with high coral cover). 5. These results are likely influenced by the relatively low intensity of human use, both on the Great Barrier Reef in general and at the particular monitoring sites studied. Over time, as local populations and tourism increase, the effect of protection may become more evident at LTMP sites. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-term Monitoring Programme; Benthos; Coral cover; Disturbance; Great Barrier Reef; Marine protected areas; Substrate condition","Australasia; Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Pacific Ocean; Queensland; Alcyonacea; Anthozoa; benthos; coral reef; environmental disturbance; environmental monitoring; line transect; marine park; videography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70350686580"

Knowing this, national park staff at Lake Mead National Recreation Area in the southwestern United States had a program in place for early detection of the non-native, invasive quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis. ). Upon finding the mussel in January 2007, managers moved quickly to access funding and the best available science to implement a response. Managers considered four options-doing nothing, closing the park, restricting movement on the lakes, and educating and enforcing park visitors-and decided to focus on education and enforcing existing laws. Nonetheless, quagga spread throughout the park and soon began to appear throughout the western United States. I examined why efforts to control the expansion failed and determined the general lessons to be learned from this case. Concentrating human visitation on the lakes through land-use zoning opened a pathway for invasion, reduced management options, and led to the rapid spread of quagga. To reconcile competing mandates to protect nature and provide recreation, zoning in parks has become a common practice worldwide. It reduces stress on some areas of a park by restricting and thus concentrating human activity in particular areas. Concentrating the human activity in one area does three things: cements pathways that repeatedly import and export vectors of non-native invasive species; creates the disturbed area necessary to enable non-native invasive species to gain a foothold; and, establishes a source of invasions that, without appropriate controls, can quickly spread to a park's wilderness areas. ©2010 Society for Conservation Biology.","Conservation mandate; Dreissena rostriformis bugensis; Invasive species; Land-use zoning; National park; Non-native; Protected area; Quagga mussels","Animals; Bivalvia; Conservation of Natural Resources; Demography; Nevada; Population Dynamics; Recreation; Lake Mead; United States; Dreissena; Dreissena bugensis; Dreissena rostriformis; Equus quagga; biodiversity; bivalve; conservation management; environmental legislation; human activity; invasive species; land use; national park; recreational activity; recreational management; animal; article; bivalve; demography; economics; environmental protection; methodology; physiology; population dynamics; recreation; United States; bivalve; environmental protection; physiology; procedures","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954748887"

Fewer than 500 birds are estimated to remain in the Indian subcontinent, whilst the Indochinese breeding population is primarily restricted to grasslands surrounding the Tonle Sap lake, Cambodia. We conducted the first comprehensive breeding season survey of Bengal Florican within the Tonle Sap region (19,500 km2). During 2005/06 and 2006/07 we systematically sampled 1-km squares for territorial males. Bengal Florican were detected within 90 1-km squares at a mean density of 0.34 males km-2 which, accounting for unequal survey effort across grassland blocks, provides a mean estimate of 0.2 males km-2. Based on 2005 habitat extent, the estimated Tonle Sap population is 416 adult males (333 - 502 ± 95% CI), more than half of them in Kompong Thom province. Tonle Sap grasslands are rapidly being lost due to intensification of rice cultivation and, based on satellite images, we document declines of 28% grassland cover within 10 grassland blocks between January 2005 and March 2007. Based on mean 2005 population densities the remaining grassland may support as few as 294 adult male florican, a decline of 30% since 2005. In response to these habitat declines almost 350 km2 of grassland have been designated as protected areas, set aside for biodiversity and local livelihoods. Conservation activities in these areas include participatory land-use zoning, patrols reporting new developments to government officials, awareness-raising and incentive-led nest protection schemes. © 2009 BirdLife International.","","Asia; Cambodia; Eurasia; Southeast Asia; Aves; Houbaropsis bengalensis; Otididae; bird; conservation management; conservation status; endangered species; grassland; population distribution; protected area; species conservation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-67650453732"

In order to preserve marine biodiversity, ecosystem function, and the goods and services provided by resistant and/or resilient systems, marine reserves have been increasingly recommended as part of an ecosystem-based approach to management (Browman and Stergiou, 2004; Levin et al., 2009). Marine reserves are defined as “areas of the ocean completely protected from all extractive and destructive activities” (Lubchenco et al., 2003) and can be experimental controls for evaluating the impact of these activities on marine ecosystems. Growing scientific information has shown consistent increases in species density, biomass, size, and diversity in response to full protection inside reserves of varying sizes and ages located in diverse regions (Claudet et al., 2008; Lester et al., 2009; Molloy et al., 2009). However, most of these data are from individual marine reserves and therefore have inherently limited transferability to networks of marine reserves, which when properly designed can outperform single marine reserves for a variety of ecological, economic, and social management goals (Roberts et al., 2003; Almany et al., 2009; Gaines et al., 2010). The concept of marine reserve networks grew out of a desire to achieve both conservation and fishery management goals by minimizing the potential negative economic, social, and cultural impacts of a single large reserve while still producing similar or even greater ecological and economic returns (Murray et al., 1999; Gaines et al., 2010). In addition, reserves networks can provide insurance by protecting areas across a region and spreading the risk that these sites may be impacted by localized catastrophes such as hurricanes or oil spills (Allison et al., 2003). The World Conservation Union’s Marine Programme defines a network as “a collection of individual marine protected areas (MPAs) or reserves operating co-operatively and synergistically, at various spatial scales and with a range of protection levels that are designed to meet objectives that a single reserve cannot achieve” (IUCN–WCPA, 2008). However, general terms such as “co-operatively” and “synergistically” can have myriad meanings. Without a clear definition of a network, it becomes difficult to identify attainable management goals and design a process for evaluating whether the network achieves those goals. Besides, different management goals may in turn result in the need for different types of networks. The use of MPAs with varying protection levels together with no-take zones in multiple-zoning schemes adds another layer of complexity to network design and evaluation; however, partially protected areas are generally used to manage coastal uses and avoid conflicts (rather than for strict ecological purposes) and are therefore a function of the local social, economic, and cultural context. As we are here interested in the ecological effects of networks, for the purposes of this chapter, we focus on marine reserves because these areas are no-take and therefore offer greater ecological benefits than other types of MPAs that allow some forms of extraction (Lester and Halpern, 2008). © Cambridge University Press 2011.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925642334"

This bay encompass a great variety of marine and coastal ecosystems, including fish, planktonic, and benthic communities as well as species that in conjunction with the environmental features form an area of high heterogeneity and unique biodiversity in the province of La Guajira. The purpose of this research was to design the first MPA in the north of the Province through the evaluation of ecologic criteria, as well as proposed conservation and management objectives; setting up a management category within the existing National Protected Areas System (SINAP in Spanish). Therefore, based on secondary information and following the ""The five S framework"", methodology design by The Nature Conservancy for site planning, five conservation objectives (OdC) of coarse-filter or habitats were identified: corals, seagrasses, sandy beaches, rocky coasts and mangroves ecosystems, and three OdC of fine filter: areas with presence of Crocodylus acutus, sea turtles' feeding areas, and areas of birds congregation. A viability analysis was developed for each healthy object found within the area, thus reflecting the biodiversity health of the area. The analysis of criteria, viability and the definition of the management objectives for the area, allowed the election of National Natural Park as the most appropriate management category for the area. Based on a systematic process and with the use of the MARXAN (University of Queensland) Decision Support System (DSS), three no-take zones were identified, with which the protection of a minimum of 30% of the coverage area for each of the objects is guaranteed as the initial contribution to the internal zoning of the new MPA.","Bahía Portete; Biodiversity; Marine Protected Areas; MARXAN; National Natural Park","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878867567"

We used multi-criteria evaluation and multi-objective land allocation for zoning the sanctuary, which covers an area of about 866km2. First, we prepared a land use map of the area using classification of the IRS 6 (AWiFS) data of May 2005. For zoning this region, nine major criteria including wildlife habitat, vegetation cover, soil, distance to historical places, water resources, road, scenic beauties in the landscape, and also to residential areas, and to the core zone were considered. We used the analytical hierarchy process to derive weights of the criteria and then applied a weighted linear combination technique to combine the factors. The degree of suitability was defined by applying Fuzzy membership function. The wildlife sanctuary was divided into four zones including conservation, recreation, rehabilitation, and cultural zones, consisting of 69%, 21%, 9.5% and 0.5% of the area, respectively.

Views were sought about the main objectives of marine protection, ideal zonation of MPAs and the ways to manage stakeholders' competing interests in MPAs. There was good agreement on the objectives of marine protection; conservation and fisheries management scored highly, while research, education and tourism had lower scores. However, there was disagreement on which objective was most important, with most stakeholders listing conservation, while fishers listed fisheries management. Most stakeholders considered MPAs that had been established for longer periods of time to offer more conservation than fisheries benefits. Analysis of the perceptions shows strong preference for having MPAs with different use zonations, including designated areas for recreational fishing, diving and the full protection of species and ecosystems. The results point to a need for increased dialogue between scientists, managers and fishers to improve the disparity in understanding the fisheries benefits of marine protection between these groups. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Traditional fisheries management has failed to avoid overexploitation of most coastal marine resources. Management measures based on an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) are thus required. Spatial management covers various ranges of properties that may enhance usual regulatory means. If spatial considerations are explicitly integrated in fisheries management, the latter may contribute to zoning design in order to balance the economic, social and biological values of natural marine resources. While traditional fisheries management approaches protect resource based on population numbers, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) protect ecosystem in space. Besides their ecological effects on fish assemblages within its boundaries, MPAs can enhance adjacent artisanal fisheries. MPAs can thus ensure the sustainability of fisheries and at the same time maintain non-fisheries benefits of marine ecosystems to society.","Coastal resources; Ecological economics; Ecology; Fisheries management; Integrated Coastal Zone Management (IZCM); Marine Protected Areas (MPAS); Spatial management","coastal zone management; ecological economics; fishery management; marine park; marine resource; nearshore environment; protected area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34247588666"

Advances in marine remote sensing, together with the novel integration of landscape ecology and advanced niche modelling techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to reliably model and map marine species distributions across many kilometres of coral reef ecosystems. We developed a multi-scale approach using three-dimensional seafloor morphology and across-shelf location to predict spatial distributions for five common Caribbean fish species. Seascape topography was quantified from high resolution bathymetry at five spatial scales (5-300 m radii) surrounding fish survey sites. Model performance and map accuracy was assessed for two high performing machine-learning algorithms: Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modelling (MaxEnt). The three most important predictors were geographical location across the shelf, followed by a measure of topographic complexity. Predictor contribution differed among species, yet rarely changed across spatial scales. BRT provided 'outstanding' model predictions (AUC = &gt;0.9) for three of five fish species. MaxEnt provided 'outstanding' model predictions for two of five species, with the remaining three models considered 'excellent' (AUC = 0.8-0.9). In contrast, MaxEnt spatial predictions were markedly more accurate (92% map accuracy) than BRT (68% map accuracy). We demonstrate that reliable spatial predictions for a range of key fish species can be achieved by modelling the interaction between the geographical location across the shelf and the topographic heterogeneity of seafloor structure. This multi-scale, analytic approach is an important new cost-effective tool to accurately delineate essential fish habitat and support conservation prioritization in marine protected area design, zoning in marine spatial planning, and ecosystem-based fisheries management. © 2011 Pittman, Brown.","","Algorithms; Animals; Area Under Curve; Biodiversity; Caribbean Region; Coral Reefs; Fishes; Geography; Models, Biological; Oceans and Seas; Puerto Rico; Regression Analysis; Species Specificity; Anthozoa; accuracy; algorithm; article; controlled study; coral reef; ecosystem; fish; geographic distribution; machine learning; multi scale approach; nonhuman; prediction; sea; species habitat; species identification; statistical model; topography; algorithm; animal; area under the curve; biodiversity; biological model; Central America; geography; growth, development and aging; Puerto Rico; regression analysis; species difference","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79957567961"

Current legislation distinguishes various typesof marine protected areas, each allowing different levels of resource extraction. However, almost all of the theory for spatial conservation planning is focused on identifying no-takereserves. The current approaches to zoning for multiple typesof protected areas could result in suboptimal plans in terms of protecting biodiversity and minimizing negative socioeconomic impacts. We overcame these limitations in the first application of the multizone planning tool, Marxan with Zones, to design a network of four types of protected areas in the context of California's Marine Life Protection Act. We have produced a zoning configuration that entails mean value losses of less than 9% for every fishery, without compromising conservation goals. We also found that a spatial numerical optimization tool that allows for multiple zones outperforms a tool that can identify one zone (ie marine reserves) in two ways: first, the overall impact on the fishing industry is reduced, and second, a more equitable impact on different fishing sectors is achieved. Finally, we examined the tradeoffs between representing biodiversity features and impacting fisheries. Our approach is applicable to both marine and terrestrial conservation planning, and delivers an ecosystem-based management outcome that balances conservation and industry objectives. © The Ecological Society of America.","","biodiversity; conservation planning; fishery regulation; habitat conservation; marine park; marine policy; trade-off; zoning system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77956644513"

Fisheries management is relatively new in the area, particularly the aspect of managing fish stocks with wide distribution patterns crossing jurisdictional boundaries. Nevertheless, stakeholders are taking bold steps toward improving fisheries management. The impetus to take action comes from the realization that coastal habitats can no longer sustain the level of exploitation to which they have been exposed. The initiative is facilitated by the USAID-funded Fisheries Improved for Sustainable Harvests (FISH) Project in collaboration with various partners. The EBM approach of the FISH Project is incremental and builds on existing management systems and utilizes existing legal and institutional frameworks while encouraging progress toward ecosystem-wide management. Fisheries management tools include coastal management, marine protected areas, limitations on fishing effort and gear, control of extraction of specific life stages of important species, licensing, zoning, and coastal law enforcement. One FISH Project goal is to increase fish biomass by at least 10% in 2010 over the 2004 baseline. Monitoring data collected in 2006 and 2008 to quantify changes against baseline data for key indicators have generally shown incremental improvements based on fisheries-independent surveys and MPA assessments. The Danajon Bank experience shows that there are three major components in working toward EBM: (1) fisheries management interventions should always consider a defined ecosystem boundary as resource management unit; (2) there is a need to understand the dynamics of marine ecosystems and how they respond to human-induced changes, particularly to changes resulting from fisheries; and (3), there is a need for a governance system that supports limits to fisheries resource exploitation activities. The match between the spatial range of the ecosystem and the governance system is the most important consideration and will play an important role in scaling up of fisheries management initiatives. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Ecosystem-based management; Fisheries monitoring; Governance","Asia; Bohol [(ISL) Visayas]; Eurasia; Philippines; Southeast Asia; Visayas; Biomass; Fish; Fisheries; Human resource management; Meats; Resource allocation; Baseline data; Coastal habitats; Coastal management; Distribution patterns; Double barriers; Ecosystem-based management; Fish stock; Fisheries management; Fisheries monitoring; Fishing effort; Governance systems; Incremental improvements; Institutional framework; Key indicator; Life stages; Management systems; Marine ecosystem; Marine protected area; Philippines; Project goals; Resource management; Scaling-up; Sustainable harvest; barrier reef; ecosystem approach; ecosystem management; exploitation; fishery management; governance approach; institutional framework; stakeholder; stock assessment; Ecosystems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70449638001"

During several recent MPA designation processes, concerns have arisen over the scientific justification for no-take MPAs, particularly those that restrict recreational fishing for pelagic species. An important question is: under what conditions might recreational pelagic fishing be compatible with the conservation goals of an MPA that is primarily focused on benthic communities? In 2005, an expert workshop of fisheries biologists, marine ecologists, MPA managers, and recreational fishermen was convened by NOAAs National MPA Center to evaluate the limited empirical data on benthic-pelagic coupling and to help provide practical advice on this topic. The participants (i) proposed a preliminary conceptual framework for addressing vertical zoning, (ii) developed preliminary guidelines to consider when evaluating whether to allow or restrict pelagic fishing in an MPA, and (iii) identified future research priorities for understanding benthic-pelagic coupling. A suite of ecological conditions where recreational pelagic fishing may not be compatible with benthic conservation were identified: (1) high relief habitats, (2) depths shallower than 50-100 m (depending upon the specific location), (3) major topographic and oceanographic features, and (4) spawning areas. Similarly, pelagic fishing is not likely to affect benthic communities adversely in many circumstances. Until further scientific study can shed more light on the issue of how benthic-pelagic linkages affect specific conservation targets, the proposed framework in this manuscript provides practical, easily-applied guidance for using vertical zoning to manage fishing in multiple use MPAs that focus on benthic conservation.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-62349103463"

With provisions for marine protected areas (MPAs) and integrated oceans management, the Oceans Act was meant to address the existing piecemeal approach to oceans management, by moving to a new approach founded in the concepts of sustainable development and ecosystem-based management. However, the past 13 years of implementation of the Act have highlighted a number of challenges that are affecting the degree to which oceans management is actually changing ""in the water."" Most fundamental is the lack of adequate governance mechanisms that will ensure compliance by all parts of the Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and by other federal departments, and enhanced collaboration with all levels of government, including provinces, territories and First Nations. Coupled with inadequate funding, no timelines for completion of plans for MPAs, and the lack of accountability mechanisms, Canada's ocean estate continues to be managed on the piecemeal, sector-by-sector approach that the Oceans Act was meant to replace. More recently, global best practice inMPA establishment ismoving to networks and hugeMPAs that are fully protected from all human activities, while broader oceans management is moving from an integrated approach to one that includes marine spatial planning and ocean zoning.

In the United States, inclusion of both individual buildings and districts on the National Register of Historic Places is a matter for local legislation through historic protection ordinances. Conservation areas are designated by the local authority while the initial recommendation for designating a building or district will be made by a body set up under the historic preservation ordinance. The criteria used are remarkably similar to those in England for selecting buildings for listing. The protection of conservation areas is primarily a matter for the application of general development control powers under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. For the historic preservation ordinance, it is the usual practice to establish an administrative body, a Historic District Commission, to identify areas for protection and to implement the requirements of the ordinance. The restrictions imposed by local historic protection ordinances or zoning ordinances in the United States appear much stricter than the legal controls over conservation areas in England. Restrictions do not usually apply to alterations to the interior of buildings in the historic district as with conservation area controls in England. In England, the involvement of the public is currently largely a matter of policy rather than a legal requirement while with the United States where due process rules have led to much greater public involvement in all aspects of the decision-making process.","Conservation areas; Planning control; United States","England; Eurasia; Europe; North America; United Kingdom; United States; Western Europe; decision making; environmental legislation; environmental policy; heritage conservation; landscape protection; local participation; national planning; protected area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-37849185090"

Limitations are described as resulting from institutional differences between land and sea resources such as the lack of private ownership in the sea, and differences in physical characteristics such as the fluid nature of marine resources. Despite these differences, some trends in land protection are relevant for marine protection, such as the increased role of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). This article examines how marine protection strategies develop from an NGO's terrestrial experience. I researched marine conservation tools used by three land trusts and point out limitations and opportunities related to their use. Tools these organizations have adapted from their land protection experience are management partnerships, acquisition, strategic planning, zoning, and database development. The extent to which these organizations use previous land experience for marine conservation may depend on geographic location and on institutional and organizational characteristics.","Acquisition; Land trusts; Marine protected areas; Nongovernmental organizations; Zoning","conservation management; environmental protection; marine park; nongovernmental organization; zoning system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-58049208280"

We also used logistic regression analyses to examine key environmental, socioeconomic and institutional drivers associated with deforestation. One of the areas, La Montaña (LM) at Hopelchen, Campeche, is part of the northern section and buffer zone of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (CBR) as well as part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. LM is an agricultural forest frontier region economically dependent on productive activities. The other study, Zona Maya (ZM), found at the municipality of Felipe Carrillo Puerto in Quintana is characterized by having developed community-based forestry enterprises with world wide recognition. In addition, the major tourism industry in nearby Cancun and Riviera Maya provide an important source of off-farm labor and temporary migration. Results show contrasting annual deforestation rates among the two study areas, being greater in the Campeche site (0.7% from 2000 to 2005) compared to Quintana Roo (-0.002% from 2000 to 2004). Logistic regression results show that the occurrence of land clearing at LM is significantly related to demographic variables as well as soil-environment types and conservation status did not reveal to relate to LUCC processes at all. At Quintana Roo, despite twice the population density, population variables at large did not strongly correlate to forest clearing. Rather forest conservation or maintenance was shown to be influenced by local community forestry institutions and a landscape zoning provided by larger management goals from the part of the communities. Greater availability of wage labor for the prominent tourism economy may also reflect a lesser dependence on agriculture and contribute to the much lower deforestation rate. Nonetheless, results show that community forest management can play an effective role in forest conservation. We argue for a regional land use management approach as a conservation strategy in which local inhabitants are considered key actors. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Using a structured questionnaire (n = 543) and a focus group (n = 6), the research examines the level of support for the concept of marine zoning and identifies key factors influencing support or opposition. Results indicate that a small majority of recreational boaters support the concept of marine zoning, but that there are areas of concern that ought to be addressed as MPA implementation proceeds. Support for zoning was strongly related to perceived benefits, particularly environmental benefits. Furthermore, perceived benefits overall were found to outweigh concerns as determinants of recreational boater support for zoning. Major dimensions of opposition included perceptions of over-regulation, loss of access for boating, and mistrust of the government. A suggestion is that such concerns may be mitigated through focused communication and meaningful involvement of boaters in the zoning process. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Marine protected areas; Marine zoning; Recreational boating; Southern strait of georgia; Stakeholder attitudes","British Columbia; Canada; Strait of Georgia; Environmental protection; Multi agent systems; Georgia; Marine protected area; Marine zoning; Recreational boating; Stakeholder attitudes; attitudinal survey; boating; protected area; recreational activity; stakeholder; zoning system; Zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77958456166"

Expert working groups were tasked separately with: 1) criteria identification and weighting; 2) scoring of no-take zones; 3) prioritizing and determining uncertainty; and 4) analysis of results and sensitivity testing. Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) revealed that both groups had similar perspectives and recommendations, despite weighting the individual planning criteria differently. Significantly, ""manageability"" scores for no-take zones from MCA appeared to correlate well with past numbers of enforcement actions recorded for each zone. This provides empirical evidence that adopting manageability criteria during the planning of MPAs could lead to a marked increase in voluntary compliance. As a result, greater consideration to compliance planning during MPA design and zoning is recommended in order to optimize voluntary compliance. Whilst the majority of no-take zones in the PSGLMP case study were evaluated as being relatively effective in terms of optimizing voluntary compliance, there remains considerable potential to improve design, management and use of the poorer performing zones.

We found differences in assemblages among regions separated on a scale of ∼10s of kilometres. Of the environmental variables measured in the present study (depth, temperature, water current speed), current speed had the greatest influence on the structure of pelagic assemblages. Carcharhinus galapagensis, Seriola rivoliana and Scomber australasicus had similar distributions and were associated with low flow environments. Senola lalandi was associated with the higher flow environments sampled during our surveys, although current speeds in the sample area were relatively slow (0.03 to 0.34 m s-1; mean 0.17 m s-1). Relationships between pelagic assemblages and current speed were detected when abundances were calculated using an area-based approximation for plume dispersal, but were not detected using a linear approximation, or when current was assumed constant across all BRUV deployments. Our results demonstrate the difficulty in separating the dual effects of current speed in BRUV studies: the effect of current on bait plume size and associated estimates of fish abundance, and the role of current as an aspect of preferred pelagic fish habitat. We recommend the use of area-based approximations of plume dispersal and the inclusion of accurate estimates of current speed as a statistical covariate when interpreting mid-water BRUV data. Our results indicate that oceanographic characteristics can be important for pelagic fish habitat selection over the scale of kilometres and should be considered during marine protected area zoning. © Inter-Research 2007.","Carangidae; Carcharhinidae; Galapagos whaler; Lord Howe Island; Marine protected area (MPA); No-take sanctuary zone; Oceanography; Shark","Australasia; Australia; Lord Howe Island; New South Wales; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Carangidae; Carcharhinidae; Carcharhinus galapagensis; Chondrichthyes; Scomber australasicus; Seriola rivoliana; abundance; assessment method; bait; dispersal; habitat selection; marine park; oceanography; pelagic fish; shark; standardization; underwater camera","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-37849011297"

The study area was a dry forest dominated landscape of approximately 100 000 ha near Kamloops, BC where fire safe communities, timber harvest and the maintenance of biodiversity are important social expectations. Conventional partial cut harvesting treatments maintained timber yields but strongly reduced the area supporting high snag densities, provided low levels of understory productivity and diminished the area that was undisturbed for extended periods. In contrast, the application of extensive fuel management treatments designed to prevent extreme fire behaviour diminished timber flow, but, as with partial cut harvesting, reduced the area with high snag densities and extended periods without disturbance. The application and maintenance of extensive fuel management treatments was also the most costly treatment. Alternatives, such as strategically placed fuel management treatments in critical zones around communities or areas with high investments, diminished costs and somewhat mitigated the reduction in snag densities. More complex land use zoning approaches that incorporate specific practices (e.g. protected areas) to maintain high quality wildlife habitat, and treatments that promote productive understories, appear to hold promise if multiple forest values and objectives are to be maintained in the long-term. We conclude that forest landscape modelling can and should be used to assess the consequences of current or new management initiatives prior to their application to ensure expectations regarding costs and achievement of objectives are realistic.

Residents and users of coastal areas often perceive marine conservation and management as limiting factors to economic development. Under these conditions, the creation of comprehensive systems of marine protected areas (MPAs) can be problematic. We selected a stretch of coast in southern Italy as a representative example of a Mediterranean coastline and nearshore marine ecosystems, featuring a complex matrix of vulnerable habitats in a landscape fragmented by multiple human activities and associated stressors. Through the use of site-selection algorithms, we investigated how human activities constrain MPA planning. Rather than assuming that patches of the same habitat found at different locations are interchangeable, we considered the scenario of a heterogeneous landscape of human impacts creating high variability in habitat quality. Despite widespread human influence, identification of portions of habitats to be protected from direct human disturbance as core no-take areas is still possible using the inclusion of 10 and 30% of low and high priority habitat, respectively, in reserves as a conservation target. Implementation of MPAs with a limited protection scheme that also include several small no-take areas could represent a feasible strategy for the conservation of Mediterranean coastal marine habitats. Moreover, MPAs could be combined with coastal zoning of activities as a means of further controlling effects over broader areas and allowing for recovery of degraded areas. Site-selection algorithms are invaluable tools for conservation planning. However, careful consideration of the potential constraints imposed by local human activities and future research aimed at filling existing gaps in understanding the ecology are crucial for making this approach useful in marine conservation planning. © Inter-Research 2009.","Biodiversity; Human impacts and constraints; Marine protected areas; Marine seascapes; MARXAN; Mediterranean Sea; MPA networks; Site-selection algorithms","Mediterranean Sea; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; conservation planning; economic development; environmental degradation; habitat fragmentation; habitat quality; human activity; marine park; population density; reserve design; resource use; site selection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-60949083977"

This attempt shapes the way nature is represented by the hegemonic environmentalist discourse and is accompanied by two core assumptions: a tendency to anticipate any human intervention in the natural realm as undesirable, and a postulate that mankind is innately malign. Based on nature’s intrinsicality, ecocentrist claims rearrange the relationship between society and nature along the subject-object controversy of modernity. It was first mankind as a subject that exploited nature as an object, which is supposed to have led to the disturbance of natural equilibria. Under the attribution of intrinsic value to nature, post modern theses ascribe subject status to nature and promote a reciprocality between society and nature as one between equal subjects. Indeed, this seems to have inspired much endeavour to justify the cohabitation of human and non-human agents within the recently advanced actor-network theory. However, a critical reconstruction of the principles of hegemonic environmentalism reveals that mankind is after all rendered an object: it is nature’s needs that must come foremost and be satisfied by mankind. Such a ŉature’ has been epitomized within protected areas under the implementation of varying zoning systems, which in former decades have frequently led to relocation of local communities. The implications of biocentric and ecocentric accounts for environmental education are highly significant, especially in terms of value prioritization. For instance, when environmentalists maintain that a particular being ought to be valued for what it is ‘in itself’, they seem to think of nature’s intrinsic value as some kind of non-instrumental value, the value that a being has as an end in itself. In this case, a paradox coexistence becomes explicit: nature’s intrinsic value is declared just to guarantee natural elements an agency, which allows them to defend their interests in a consequentialistic manner. At the same time, humans as part of the extended moral community are justified to maintain their instrumental value of nonhumans, which obviously remains legitimate even after nature’s intrinsic value has been declared. The joint reference of biocentrists to both the instrumental and intrinsic value, although inherently contradictory, is indispensable for environmental ethics if the moral community is to incorporate at least some part of the most sentient non-human nature. The resolution of such a contradiction has to be brought into focus for environmental education to develop critical thinking. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The results are as follows; (1) It is feasible to adopt MCR to optimize spatial patterns of land resources on the basis of spatial analysis technology and the drawing analysis tools of "" cost-distance weight"" ; (2) The horizontal ecological process way act as a control on landscape, with the evergreen broad-leaved forests and Pinus khasya forests in this region as the protected source. MCR way be used to construct the ecological pattern components of corridors, radiation roads, and strategic points. These components not only work to maintain the ecological functioning of land resources, but also play a crucial role in the migration and proliferation of the native animal species. ( 3 ) A map showing the frequency sequence and inflection points are constructed according to the MCR resistance value. The heterogeneity of land use types is greater on either side of the inflection point, which can serve as a basis for zoning of land function. By this means, six functional areas of land, which are beneficial to ecological stability, are laid out, namely the core source protected area co-buffer area, eco-transition zone,eco-fringe zone,farming area and residential area. Management measures for each functional area are put forward.","Ecological optimizing of spatial patterns; Geographic information system (gis); Land resource; Minimal cumulative resistance (mcr) model","Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Yunnan; Animalia; broad-leaved forest; coniferous forest; cost-benefit analysis; ecosystem function; erosion control; GIS; land use; map; native species; optimization; remote sensing; spatial analysis; transition zone","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70350176315"

Although those areas are connected biologically over distances >600 km, lack of large-scale sampling and attention to taxa other than scleractinian corals has limited the protection of shallow coral reef and coral community habitats in some areas of the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) region, particularly non-offshore islands in Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica. The newly created Las Perlas marine protected area (1688 km2), the second largest archipelago in the TEP, fills a regional conservation gap for the protection of reefs and potentially becomes the second highest coral diversity area in the MCCTEP. This study describes the distribution of live coral cover and species alpha-diversity over 307 ha of shallow coral reefs and coral communities in the Las Perlas Archipelago. Nineteen scleractinian and 38 octocorals were observed, including species previously thought to be uncommon. Although coral communities generally had a greater number of species than coral reefs, species richness did not differ between habitats. However, their coral and octocoral composition and benthic makeup (coral cover, macroalgae, sponge, etc.) differed. The reefs had higher live coral cover (61.2%) and lower algal cover (32.5%) than the coral communities (26.0% and 65.7%, respectively). Octocorals were more common in the communities than on the reefs. There was a negative relationship between live coral cover and species richness, low to moderate cover generally coinciding with coral community sites and higher species richness. Areas are recommended for marine reserve zoning within the new Las Perlas marine protected area to ensure the protection of important habitats and maintenance of diversity in the TEP, both highlighting the importance of the southern islands of the archipelago for coral diversity and the northern islands for their high live coral cover. Review of the representativeness of regional coral diversity would facilitate better design of small-scale reserves across the TEP, following comparable survey methods. © 2008 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.","Alpha-diversity; Coral reefs; Las Perlas; Marine reserves; Panama","Central America; Costa Rica; Ecuador; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical); Panama [Central America]; Pearl Islands; South America; algae; Anthozoa; Pisces; Scleractinia; Algae; Fish; Marine engineering; Ocean habitats; conservation management; coral reef; marine park; population distribution; species diversity; species richness; Large-scale sampling; Shallow coral reef; Biodiversity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-43149093552"

However, the lack of zoning is common for most protected areas in developing countries and, as a consequence, many protected areas are not effective in achieving the goals for which they were created. In this work, we introduce a quantitative method to expeditiously zone protected areas and we evaluate its ecological implications on hypothetical zoning cases. A real-world application is reported for the Talampaya National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Argentina. Our method is a modification of the zoning forest model developed by Bos [Bos, J., 1993. Zoning in forest management: a quadratic assignment problem solved by simulated annealing. Journal of Environmental Management 37, 127-145.]. Main innovations involve a quadratic function of distance between land units, non-reciprocal weights for adjacent land uses (mathematically represented by a non-symmetric matrix), and the possibility of imposing a connectivity constraint. Due to its intrinsic spatial dimension, the zoning problem belongs to the NP-hard class, i.e. a solution can only be obtained in non-polynomial time [Nemhausser, G., Wolsey, L., 1988. Integer and Combinatorial Optimization. John Wiley, New York.]. For that purpose, we applied a simulated annealing heuristic implemented as a FORTRAN language routine. Our innovations were effective in achieving zoning designs more compatible with biological diversity protection. The quadratic distance term facilitated the delineation of core zones for elements of significance; the connectivity constraint minimized fragmentation; non-reciprocal land use weightings contributed to better representing management decisions, and influenced mainly the edge and shape of zones. This quantitative method can assist the zoning process within protected areas by offering many zonation scheme alternatives with minimum cost, time and effort. This ability provides a new tool to improve zoning within protected areas in developing countries. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of marine reserves are heterogeneous. Despite theoretical findings, empirical studies have previously found no effect of size on the effectiveness of marine reserves in protecting commercial fish stocks. Using 58 datasets from 19 European marine reserves, we show that reserve size and age do matter: Increasing the size of the no-take zone increases the density of commercial fishes within the reserve compared with outside; whereas the size of the buffer zone has the opposite effect. Moreover, positive effects of marine reserve on commercial fish species and species richness are linked to the time elapsed since the establishment of the protection scheme. The reserve size-dependency of the response to protection has strong implications for the spatial management of coastal areas because marine reserves are used for spatial zoning. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Asymmetrical analysis of variance; Coastal marine ecosystems; Commercial species; Fish assemblages; Heterogeneity; Marine protected area; Marine reserve age; Marine reserve design; Marine reserve network; Marine reserve size; Weighted meta-analysis","Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Biodiversity; Conservation of Energy Resources; Europe; Fisheries; Fishes; Mediterranean Sea; Time Factors; Pisces; age; commercial species; environmental protection; marine park; reserve design; size effect; species richness; animal; article; Atlantic Ocean; biodiversity; energy conservation; Europe; fish; food industry; Mediterranean Sea; time","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-41849136120"

According to the National Habitat Classification and Map of the Republic of Croatia, there are 25 habitat types in the area of the nature park. Five of these are endangered at the European level and protected by the Habitats Directive. Kopački Rit Nature Park has been included on the Ramsar list as valuable natural heritage within the international framework. The floodplain area of Kopački Rit is essential due to the coherence and diversity of terrestrial and aquatic ecological systems. The paper addresses the need for ecological and spatial valorisation of the protected area as an instrument for discriminating between primary and secondary protection. Kopački Rit is a floodplain area resulting from the activity of two large rivers: the Danube and the Drava. Spatial analysis of Kopački Rit Nature Park was made on the basis of the existing spatial plan (2006) of the area. Comparative methods, as well as the analysis and synthesis method were used for the process. A qualitative analytical method with element gradation within four analysis fields was used - strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT analysis). A structural area analysis (Figure 1) was made according to Lynch (1972). The effect of the activities on biological and landscape diversity was analyzed in the results. The analysis included the effects of forestry, water management, agriculture, game management, traffic, and war events (Table 1 and 2). Based on the management plan, zonation was performed by defining the main zones and determining the sub-zones (Figure 2). The zones were described and the zonation criteria and management goals were provided. In doing so, the difference between the zones of strict protection and active protection was accentuated. The goal of management is to ensure a sustainable use of floodplain valleys and allow visits, recreational fishing, hunting, forestry and agriculture. In order to improve habitat quality, use of the area should be limited by management measures. Ecological and spatial analyses of the protected nature park area were used to determine the difference between individual units within Kopački Rit. Special zones of the basic phenomenon were highlighted, which coincides with the zoning concept within the nature park. In this sense, primary and secondary protection was discriminated.","Diversity; Habitat; Nature protection; Sustainable development; Zoning","Agriculture; Ecosystems; Forestry; Forests; Sustainable Forest Management; Water Management; Croatia; Kopacki Rit Nature Park; Banks (bodies of water); Ecosystems; Forestry; Management; Parks; Spatial variables measurement; Sustainable development; Timber; Water management; Zoning; Active protection; Analysis and synthesis; Comparative methods; Croatia; Diversity; Ecological systems; European levels; Flood plains; Game management; Habitat; Habitat classification; Habitat quality; Habitat type; Landscape diversity; Large rivers; Management goals; Management measures; Management plans; Nature protection; Protected areas; Qualitative analytical methods; Secondary protection; Spatial analysis; Sustainable use; SWOT analysis; Valorisation; comparative study; environmental economics; floodplain; globalization; habitat quality; habitat type; protected area; qualitative analysis; species diversity; sustainable development; water management; zoning; Environmental protection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052999150"

One strategy for managing multiple uses within and around protected areas is zoning, an approach in which spatial boundaries are drawn to distinguish areas with varying degrees of allowable human impacts. However, zoning designations are rarely evaluated for their efficacy using empirical data related to both human and biodiversity characteristics. To evaluate the effectiveness of zoning designations, we developed an integrated approach. The approach was calibrated empirically using data from Wolong Nature Reserve, a flagship protected area for the conservation of endangered giant pandas in China. We analyzed the spatial distribution of pandas, as well as human impacts (roads, houses, tourism infrastructure, livestock, and forest cover change) with respect to zoning designations in Wolong. Results show that the design of the zoning scheme could be improved to account for pandas and their habitat, considering the amount of suitable habitat outside of the core zone (area designated for biodiversity conservation). Zoning was largely successful in containing houses and roads to their designated experimental zone, but was less effective in containing livestock and was susceptible to boundary adjustments to allow for tourism development. We identified focus areas for potential zoning revision that could better protect the panda population without significantly compromising existing human settlements. Our findings highlight the need for evaluating the efficacy of zoning in other protected areas facing similar challenges with balancing human needs and conservation goals, not only in China but also around the world. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Conservation; Development; Giant panda; Protected area; Zoning","China; Sichuan; Wolong Nature Reserve; Ailuropoda; Ailuropoda melanoleuca; anthropogenic effect; bear; biodiversity; endangered species; habitat conservation; human settlement; protected area; tourism development; zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-83555165081"

We analyze the features of the raw-material economy, which is still typical for Russian regions, and then we argue that contextual factors are crucial for the success of community-based governance of CPRs in creation and development of protected areas. Our focus is on the creation of the Alkhanay National Park, which was a unique event because of the competition between two rival projects: gold mining and a national park. Local contextual factors of holy Buddhist places, natural attractions, and long-standing traditions of health treatment in mineral springs played key roles. Remote contextual factors, such as the participation of Siberian scientists of the Russian Academy of Sciences in the project and the state ownership of natural resources in this area, also played a positive role in the process. A very important instrument for community-based governance is functional zoning, where different community interests of agricultural, historical, and cultural traditions; religious and native customs; and a new economy based on tourism and recreation are taken into account. We conclude that such zoning is effective for sustainable development of the area. © 2010 Springer.","Alkhanay National Park; Common-pool resources; Community-based governance; Gold mining; Russia","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77949556925"

The idea was initially stimulated by international and national interest in developing marine protected areas, e.g., the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. More recent attention has been placed on managing the multiple use of marine space, especially in areas where conflicts among users and the environment are already clear, e.g., in the North Sea. Even more recent concern has focused on the need to conserve nature, especially ecologically and biologically sensitive areas, in the context of multi-use planning of ocean space. Despite academic discussions and the fact that some countries already have started implementation, the scope of MSP has not been clearly defined. Terms such as integrated management, marine spatial management, and ocean zoning are all used inconsistently. This is one of the reasons why its importance is not more seriously reflected at the levels of policy and decision-making in most countries. This article attempts to deal with this problem. It describes why MSP is an essential step to achieve ecosystem-based sea use management, how it can be defined and what its core objectives are.

To promote transparency and facilitate communication with stakeholders, a clear step-by-step methodology needs to be adopted. This paper applies multicriteria decision analysis techniques in a spatial context to support zoning of the Paneveggio-Pale di S. Martino Natural Park (Italy). According to law provisions, the park is to be zoned into three protection levels, ranging from strict nature conservation to promotion of tourism and recreation. Firstly, spatial zoning elements were identified by partitioning the park into homogeneous land units. Subsequently, a GIS-based land suitability analysis was carried out for each protection level, and then aggregated into land units. Finally, land allocation was performed by assigning a protection level to each unit. For this purpose, a decision rule was applied based on an algorithm that optimizes choices by taking into account simultaneously the suitability of a unit for all protection levels. Different methods were tested and the stability of the results was assessed through sensitivity analysis. Through this study, we aimed at suggesting to park's management and other stakeholders an approach that is scientifically sound and practical. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

MPAs encompass a range of protection levels, from fully protected no-take reserves to restriction of only particular activities, gear types, user groups, target species, or extraction periods. There is a growing body of scientific evidence supporting the ecological benefits of full reserve protection, but it is more difficult to generalize about the effects of other types of MPAs, in part because they include a range of actual protection levels. However, it is critical to determine whether partial protection and no-take reserves provide similar ecological benefits given potential economic costs of lost fishing grounds in no-take areas, common sociopolitical opposition to full protection, and promotion of partially protected areas as a compromise solution in ocean zoning disputes. Here we synthesize all empirical studies comparing biological measures (biomass, density, species richness, and size of organisms) in no-take marine reserves and adjacent partially protected and unprotected areas across a range of geographic locations worldwide. We demonstrate that while partially protected areas may confer some benefits over open access areas, no-take reserves generally show greater benefits and yield significantly higher densities of organisms within their boundaries relative to partially protected sites nearby. © Inter-Research 2008.","Conservation; Marine protected areas; Marine reserves; Ocean zoning; Protection level","coastal zone management; conservation management; ecological zonation; empirical analysis; marine park; population density","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-53949105031"

Although human population density is the lowest in the region, the impact of human occurrence in protected areas on tiger Panthera tigris and prey populations was unknown. We examined the effects of human-carnivore conflict on tiger and prey abundance and distribution in the Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area on the Lao-Vietnam border. We conducted intensive camera-trap sampling of large carnivores and prey at varying levels of human population and monitored carnivore depredation of livestock across the protected area. The relative abundance of large ungulates was low throughout whereas that of small prey was significantly higher where human density was lower. The estimated tiger density for the sample area ranged from 0.2 to 0.7 per 100 km2. Tiger abundance was significantly lower where human population and disturbance were greater. Three factors, commercial poaching associated with livestock grazing followed by prey depletion and competition between large carnivores, are likely responsible for tiger abundance and distribution. Maintaining tigers in the country's protected areas will be dependent on the spatial separation of large carnivores and humans by modifying livestock husbandry practices and enforcing zoning. © 2006 The Zoological Society of London.","Carnivores; Human-wildlife conflict; Laos; Mark-recapture; Protected areas","Asia; Eurasia; Laos; Southeast Asia; Panthera; Panthera tigris; Ungulata; abundance; anthropogenic effect; carnivore; ecological impact; habitat conservation; mammal; population distribution; prey capture; protected area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33750165444"

From a review of empirical studies aiming at assessing the ecological effects of Mediterranean and Macaronesian MPAs, we conclude that establishing an MPA is successful for (i) increasing the abundance/biomass, (ii) increasing the proportion of larger/older individuals, and (iii) enhancing the fecundity of commercially harvested populations; also, MPAs demonstrated to be effective for (iv) augmenting local fishery yields through biomass exportation from the protected area, and (v) inducing shifts in fish assemblage structure by increasing the dominance of large predator species. However, the attraction for tourism and diving due to ecological benefits of protection can cause damages likely to reverse some of the MPA effects. Other expected effects are more subject to uncertainty, and hence need more research, such as (vi) causing density-dependent changes in life history traits and (vii) protecting the recruitment of commercially important species, (viii) protecting marine biodiversity (including genetic diversity), (ix) causing ecosystem-wide effects such as trophic cascades, and (x) increasing community and ecosystem stability, thus promoting resilience and faster recovery from disturbance. Meta-analysis of data arising from these case studies are used to establish the overall effect of MPAs, and its relationship to MPA features, such as size of no-take area or time since protection. Based on the review and the meta-analyses, specific recommendations are provided for MPA management, regarding the establishment of goals and objectives, site selection, MPA design and zoning, planning, and monitoring. Finally, a series of recommendations for MPA research are offered to drive future research in MPA issues in the Mediterranean and Macaronesia. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

The findings and the conclusions of this research reveal a conflict between policymakers and local communities. Much closer collaboration between the two is required before any long-term policy of development can have any chance of success.

Four years after this event, Frontier-Tanzania assessed reef substrate in Misali Island Marine Conservation Area (MIMCA) using scuba surveys. Substrate cover was compared between sites within and outside the nonextraction zone (NEZ) of MIMCA and recovery rates were estimated through reference to previous studies. Coral recovery at Misali Island following the bleaching event has generally been slow, but nonextractive management of MIMCA has enhanced coral recovery within the NEZ. The absence of fishing activities in the NEZ has sustained herbivorous fish populations and thus reduced algal overgrowth; however, outside the NEZ, diving and anchoring activities have caused further coral damage and led to increased levels of debris. Awareness-raising programmes could lessen these problems and the NEZ appeared to be well-placed to capitalize on nonmanageable factors that are thought to mitigate the effects of coral bleaching. In addition, the implementation of flexible zoning schemes could improve recovery rates after future bleaching events. © 2008 Society for Environmental Exploration.","Coral bleaching; Indian Ocean; Marine protected areas; Misali; Pemba; Reef management","Africa; East Africa; Misali Island; Pemba South; Sub-Saharan Africa; Tanzania; algae; Anthozoa; coral bleaching; coral reef; fishing; marine park; mitigation; mortality; nature conservation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-57449095201"

In addition to this commercial pressure, the impact of recreational activities on fish assemblages remains barely known. Here we examined the impact of spearfishing limitation on resources in a marine protected area (MPA) and the benefit it provides for the local artisanal fishery through the use of a novel indicator. We analysed trends in the fish assemblage composition using artisanal fisheries data collected in the Bonifacio Strait Natural Reserve (BSNR), a Mediterranean MPA where the spearfishing activity has been forbidden over 15% of its area. Fish species were pooled into three response groups according to their target level by spearfishing. We developed the new flexible ReGS indicator reflecting shifts in species assemblages according to the relative abundance of each response group facing external pressure. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) increased by ca. 60% in the BSNR between 2000 and 2007, while the MPA was established in 1999. The gain of CPUE strongly depended on the considered response group: for the highly targeted group, the CPUE doubled while the CPUE of the untargeted group increased by only 15.5%. The ReGS value significantly increased from 0.31 to 0.45 (on a scale between 0 and 1) in the general perimeter of this MPA while it has reached a threshold of 0.43, considered as a reference point, in the area protected from spearfishing since 1982. Our results demonstrated that limiting recreational fishing by appropriate zoning in multiple-use MPAs represents a real benefit for artisanal fisheries. More generally we showed how our new indicator may reveal a wide range of impacts on coastal ecosystems such as global change or habitat degradation. © 2011 Rocklin et al.","","Algorithms; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Fishes; Geography; Humans; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Recreation; article; coastal waters; controlled study; environmental protection; fishery management; fishing; global change; habitat quality; Mediterranean Sea; nonhuman; population abundance; species; algorithm; animal; ecosystem; fish; food industry; geography; growth, development and aging; human; legal aspect; methodology; recreation; Southern Europe","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-80053108074"

But these small losses should not be reason for complacency. During the past 50 years, government supported, commercial fishing has resulted in the collapse of about a thousand populations that once supplied most of the world's seafood. For the collapsed species, now existing as small remnants of their former population sizes, the future is bleak. They suffer from loss of genetic diversity, inbreeding depression, and depensation. Because marine species were eliminated by historic climatic changes, continued global warming is likely to result in the extinction of small populations that already have a precarious existence. They may be considered evidence of an extinction debt that must be paid as the climate change becomes more severe. For some of the remnant species, extinction can be avoided if there is a rapid management conversion to the use of more marine protected areas (MPAs) and extensive ocean zoning where fishing is prohibited. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","","climate change; commercial activity; extinction risk; genetic variation; habitat conservation; inbreeding depression; marine park; population size; seafood","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79951769861"

The Solitary Islands Marine Park (SIMP) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, is located in a tropical-temperate biotone, with variable influence of the tropical East Australian Current (EAC) from inshore to offshore. Marine communities on the extensive, subtidal, rocky reefs are poorly described. As a result, the current Habitat Classification System (HCS) used as part of the process to determine the marine park zoning arrangements, which places all shallow reef (<25m) in the same category, is unlikely to represent real biotic patterns. 2. To evaluate the influence of five key factors (distance from shore, reef type, dominant benthos, latitude, and depth range) fish assemblages were widely surveyed, using 30-minute timed counts, at 68 sites across the extent of shallow reef within the park. Relationships between assemblage patterns and levels of the different factors were subsequently examined using multivariate analyses. 3. Patterns of reef fish assemblages were most strongly correlated with distance from shore. Three distinct assemblages occurred on inshore (<1.5 km), mid-shelf (1.5-6 km), and offshore (>6km) reefs. Differences in assemblage structure by reef type were also apparent on inshore and offshore reefs, but not on mid-shelf reefs. Correlations with the other factors were weak. The cross-shelf pattern was persistent over the scale of years. 4. The results of the study provide strong support for incorporating distance-from-shore categories into a refined HCS. This will improve its ability to represent biological diversity as reflected by patterns of reef fish assemblages. Further research is required to determine the wider application of the HCS to other marine parks in NSW and to determine if it also, effectively, represents other components of biodiversity. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Biodiversity assessment; Marine protected area; Representation; Spatial pattern; Surrogate; Tropical-temperate overlap","Australia; New South Wales; Solitary Islands Marine Park; biodiversity; community structure; habitat structure; marine park; multivariate analysis; reef; spatial analysis; surrogate method","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-73249114733"

The aims of this study were to test the precision of habitat in predicting reef fish assemblage structure, and to investigate changes in precision when varying resolutions of baseline habitat data were available. To achieve this, visual counts of reef fish species and habitat surveys were conducted at 31 sites around the island. Overall, the variations in fish assemblage among sites were moderately correlated with habitat variations, while fish assemblages were weakly spatially autocorrelated, strongly affecting sites within a proximity of 1 km. This spatial autocorrelation demonstrates that both habitat and geographical data combine for greater surrogate precision than habitat alone at this spatial scale. The ability of habitat classes to predict reef fish assemblage structure was dependent on the quality and quantity of baseline data. Differences in assemblage structure were found among habitat classes derived from detailed high-resolution data, but not among habitat classes defined from low-resolution data. This study highlights the need for accurate in situ ecological information to establish precise habitat surrogates and complementary assemblage information to more effectively site marine reserves. Otherwise, reserves may misrepresent fish diversity and be unsuccessful at long-term conservation of marine biodiversity. © Inter-Research 2008.","Diversity surrogates; Fish diversity; Marine conservation; Marine protected areas; Marine reserves; Spatial autocorrelation","Australasia; Australia; Lord Howe Island; New South Wales; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; biodiversity; conservation management; fishery management; habitat type; implementation process; in situ measurement; marine environment; marine park; precision; reef; species diversity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-39349100541"

It considers how the Marine Park zoning processes attempt to balance a range of conservation and extractive user values in achieving biodiversity objectives and a comprehensive, adequate and representative system of marine ecosystems. Achieving this balance does not occur in isolation from national and international marine biodiversity frameworks. Consistency between State and federal Marine Protected Area management is fundamental to building a resilient marine conservation system. While the Amendment Act modernises zoning, public participation and engagement and development approvals, it does not harmonise federal and State approaches to Marine Protected Area Management. This article highlights a range of opportunities for integrated marine ecosystem management by harmonising the New South Wales Marine Park system with federal management processes under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth).","","Australasia; Australia; New South Wales; biodiversity; conservation planning; ecosystem management; marine ecosystem; marine park; nature conservation; recreational management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70350365256"

In the absence of effective management, diving can also have negative impacts. This study shows how an understanding of diver specialization can be used to help manage diving and increase its effectiveness as an incentive-driven conservation activity. Surveys were used to assess motivations, satisfactions and dive history of divers in Phuket (Thailand) and categorize divers by degree of specialization. Highly specialized divers were more likely to be on a live-aboard trip than less specialized divers and placed greater importance on the characteristics of the dive itself rather than the trip. Less specialized divers put more emphasis on non-dive characteristics. Satisfaction levels differed significantly among specialization groups in terms of overall satisfaction with the dive experience, satisfactions compared with motivations and satisfactions with specific trip characteristics. Overall there was a decline in satisfaction levels with increasing specialization. These finding are compared to a wildlife tourism model that links impacts with client characteristics and suggests a displacement of specialists by generalists and changes in the limits of acceptable change (LAC) over time. The dive data supported this progression leading to increased industry competition and reduced opportunities to sustain a broad-based dive industry that will act as an incentive-driven mechanism for reef conservation. Specific actions related to reef access and zoning according to a diver opportunity spectrum (DOS), establishing LAC and monitoring programmes, enforcing safety and environmental regulations are suggested to promote a more sustainable approach to dive management. Social science insights can be used to aid reef management strategies and increase the potential for diving to contribute towards reef conservation. © 2006 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.","Coral reefs; Diving; Marine protected areas; Specialization; Sustainability; Thailand","Asia; Eurasia; Phuket [Southern Region]; Southeast Asia; Southern Region; Thailand; Anthozoa; Conservation; Ecosystems; Geological surveys; Laws and legislation; Monitoring; Reefs; conservation management; coral reef; environmental legislation; management practice; marine park; scuba diving; species conservation; sustainability; article; conservation biology; coral reef; diver; ecosystem restoration; environmental management; environmental sustainability; health survey; job satisfaction; motivation; sustainable development; tourism; Diver opportunity spectrum (DOS); Environmental regulations; Limits of acceptable change (LAC); Wildlife tourism; Environmental engineering","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33846863956"

Ecosystem based marine spatial management (EB-MSM) is an approach that recognizes the full array of interactions within an ecosystem, including human uses, rather than considering single issues, species, or ecosystem services in isolation. Marine spatial planning and ocean zoning are emerging concepts that can support EB-MSM. EB-MSM is driven by high-level goals that managers aim to achieve through the implementation of measures. High-level goals and objectives need to be translated into more operational objectives before specific targets, limits and measures can be elaborated.Monitoring, evaluation and adaptation are necessary to ensure that marine management measures are both effective and efficient. Solid monitoring frameworks are the foundation of adaptive management, as they provide the necessary information to evaluate performance and the effectiveness of management actions. Marine protected areas (MPAs) - possibly set up in networks - constitute a key component in EB-MSM policies and practises and have been applied as a cornerstone in conservation of marine biodiversity, management of fish populations, development of coastal tourism, etc. Moreover, MPA experiences have provided methods and concepts (such as zoning) to a wider EB-MSM context. The assignment of values to biophysical features of the marine environment allows the direct assessment of related management choices and may assist EB-MSM.A range of monetary valuation techniques have been proposed to reduce attributes of goods and services to a single metric. However, in the marine environment such an approach is often over simplistic, and thus less reductive techniques may be necessary. Rather than producing a single metric, the results of non-monetary assessments guide policy allowing weight to be given as necessary to potential areas of conflict and consensus.Strategies to take into account climate change effects and geohazard risks in EB-MSM have been applied or proposed worldwide. EB-MSM regimes must be alert to such risks and flexible to account for changes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","","Biodiversity; Climate change; Environmental protection; Fisheries; Management; Zoning; Adaptive Management; Critical issues; Direct assessment; Ecosystem services; Fish populations; Human use; Key component; Marine biodiversity; Marine environment; Marine management; Marine protected area; Monetary valuations; Spatial management; Spatial planning; adaptive management; climate effect; ecosystem approach; ecosystem service; environmental policy; geological hazard; global perspective; marine environment; marine park; risk assessment; spatial planning; strategic approach; sustainable development; tourism development; valuation; zoning policy; Ecosystems","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-80053475802"

By stipulating the minimum area of fishing grounds that must remain open to each local fishing community, we were able to design MPA networks that impacted local resource users more equitably and were therefore more likely to be socioeconomically viable. MPA networks that considered local tenure boundaries had a greater overall area and cost than those that sought to minimize costs to small-scale fishers as a single stakeholder group. However, in this context, established concepts of ""efficiency"" in conservation planning are likely to be less important than minimizing costs to each fishing community individually. ©2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..","Marine protected areas; Marine tenure; Marxan; Philippines; Small-scale fisheries; Socioeconomic viability; Systematic conservation planning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79957639900"

Here, we provide the first analyses that compare representation of biodiversity and three other ecosystem services across several contrasting conservation strategies in a human-dominated landscape (England).

Prominent among them are community-based management and the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). The overall poor performance of MPAs can be traced to a failure to effectively include local communities in the design and implementation of relevant measures. Recent efforts have incorporated aspects of community-based management into a hybrid form of management, which ideally builds upon existing local management practices. A key challenge lies in the development of appropriate frameworks that allow for the successful participation of local communities in management. A review of studies on MPA design and community-based marine resource management and fieldwork observations provides suggestions on how to address current socioeconomic shortcomings in MPA design and implementation, successfully involving local communities in order to provide a better local basis for effective larger MPA networks. A combination of MPA tools as the formal frame and community-based natural resource management as the adaptive core that recognizes local communities as allies, not aliens, is needed to develop successful conservation approaches.

Eighty-two species belonging to 26 families were recorded in total. The highest species richness was recorded in the western sector and was positively correlated to the number of occurring strata (i.e. combination of habitat and depth). Mean species richness (S), diversity (H') and fish total density decreased markedly with depth on soft bottom, whereas no depth-related trend was observed on Posidonia oceanica meadows, except for density. On rocky-algal reef, the highest values of S, H' and total density were recorded at 0-3 m or 4-7 m depth, depending on sector. Differences in species composition and abundance among sectors were mainly driven by the habitat and depth-related preferences of fishes. Large individuals or aggregation of recreationally important fishes were mainly located in western and southeastern sectors. The number of commercially important species was similar in the three island sectors. Nevertheless, the majority of these species showed a size distribution more skewed towards medium and large size classes in the southeastern sector than in the others. Overall, the observed pattern of fish distribution along with some socioeconomic concerns showed that the southeastern sector was the most suitable to become a no-take zone. © 2010 Unione Zoologica Italiana.","Fish assemblage; Mediterranean Sea; MPA zoning","Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (Northwest); algae; Pisces; Posidonia oceanica; coastal fishery; habitat; marine park; protected area; reef; relative abundance; size distribution; species diversity; species richness","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77953308448"

To deal with regional development problems in the long run, during the period of the 11th Five-Year Plan, land development in Fujian Province are spatially divided into four kinds of major function regions, including optimal development region, key development region, restrictive development region, and prohibited development region. According to each region's function, the governments make practical regional policies to promote regional development and rational distribution of population and economy. This paper deals with the scientific subject of Major Function Oriented Zoning (MFOZ) of Fujian Province to provide theoretical and methods information, focusing on the problems and solutions in the process of MFOZ on national level. This paper takes the view that the project of MFOZ should apply an integrated unit which contains county-scale and township-scale in order to avoid ""indiscriminate"" consequences, if obvious differences exist in both the natural environment and social development in the region. Therefore, this paper brings forward the demarcation thought of MFOZ for mountain provinces: Firstly, we regionalize the prohibited development region from all the protected areas as the main body. Secondly, comprehensive evaluation of resources are carried out at the county level to screen out the optimal development region and key development region in the plain areas of province. Then the indicators for current land exploitation intensity level are used to identify the optimal development region and the key development region. Thirdly, we make comprehensive evaluation of resources at the township-level to identify the key towns in landlocked mountainous regions. Finally, according to the division, the two spatial scales are used to integrate the major function regions.","Demarcation thought; Division scale; Fujian Province; Index system; Major Function Oriented Zoning","Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Fujian; decision making; integrated approach; mountain region; regional development; regional planning; regional policy; zoning policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70350625404"

However, preparation and implementation process of this document was extremely varied and suffered several modifications aiming its improvement. The objective of this work was to analyze the evolution of management plans in the context of national parks management, analyzing as a concrete case its implementation in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The preparation of management plans for Brazilian parks was marked by the existence of three different methodological references that was reflected in the variety of plans identified for five national parks studied here (Itatiaia NP, Serra dos Órgãos NP, Tijuca NP, Serra da Bocaina NP and Restinga da Jurubatiba NP). As a general pattern, the plans were neither prepared nor revised with the periodicity established by the legislation.

We used 786 artificial nests baited with quail eggs to examine the effect of habitat alteration on nest predation in Lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi. Natural forest and four habitats of forest margin areas: forest edge, forest gardens, coffee plantations, and secondary forest, were studied. Two types of artificial nests, ground and shrub nests were placed in these habitats at two different locations for a period of 8 days. In addition, we used automatic cameras and cage-traps to identify the predators. Nests in shrubs experienced significantly higher predation rates in forest margin areas than in natural forest. Predation on ground nests did not differ significantly between these habitat types, but was significantly higher than that on shrub nests in each habitat except forest edge. Rodents were the most common predators of both nests, but shrub nests were also susceptible to Dwarf cuscus (Strigocuscus celebensis), squirrels, and tree snakes. The nest predation rates we found were among the highest found in tropical rainforests, probably a consequence of the unique predator assemblages of Sulawesi. These results suggest that egg survival is negatively affected by human intervention and that human-induced habitats might have only limited importance for the conservation of Sulawesi's largely endemic understorey avifauna. These considerations might be important since forest margins comprise significant proportions of protected areas on Sulawesi and play an important role in future Park zoning concepts as well as in conservation-oriented land use management. © 2006 Springer.","Central Sulawesi; Conservation; Edge effects; Forest margin habitats; Indonesia; Nest predation","Asia; Central Sulawesi; Eurasia; Indonesia; Lore Lindu National Park; Southeast Asia; Aves; Phasianidae; Rodentia; Sciuridae; Serpentes; Strigocuscus celebensis; artificial nest; bait; coffee; forest ecosystem; forest edge; forest garden; habitat conservation; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; habitat type; national park; nest predation; plantation; secondary forest","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33845466930"

Comprehensive classification systems to accurately account for areas managed for biodiversity conservation are an essential component of conservation planning and policy. Traditionally, quantitative targets for reserve system auditing has used a two-dimensional measure of the surface area protected. 2. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are three-dimensional systems and where zoning of allowable uses or protection is vertically stratified, measures of surface area at sea level are potentially misleading. 3. Measuring the proportion of the volume of MPAs managed for particular purposes provides a more accurate and transparent measure of the amount of protection or management intent in a single reserve. 4. This paper outlines a number of other emerging policy issues in relation to the zoning, protection and auditing of MPAs in Australia. It will be important to ensure that zoning is clearly and accurately articulated to better inform conservation planning decisions when establishing representative systems of Marine Protected Areas.

Although inhabited for 6 millennia Socotra only began to open up to the outside world in 1990. With conservation interventions starting prior to major developments, and building on centuries-old low-intensity resource management, Socotra has been in a unique position to practice pre-emptive conservation. In 1997 modern conservation started with biodiversity and socio-economic surveys, with inputs from communities and decision makers, which fed into the Conservation Zoning Plan. Approved in 2000, this has been the archipelago's principal conservation planning and management tool. Regulations and bans on fishing practices, the collection of coral stones and export of biological materials have all been relatively well complied with by local communities and authorities. Inappropriate road construction, however, driven by non-islanders, has demonstrated the limits of the Conservation Zoning Plan, highlighting significant institutional challenges in planning and coordination. The capacity of the Socotra-based conservation institution has increased dramatically over the last decade. Its personnel are generally respected, largely because their roles include assisting local communities with development initiatives, underlining the importance of integrating conservation and development at the onset of conservation. Although the integrity of the landscape will inevitably decline, especially along the northern coastline, Socotri conservationists, backed by international support, are in a unique position to shape the archipelago's future. © 2011 Fauna & Flora International.","Conservation Zoning Plan; endemism; ICDP; pre-emptive conservation; protected areas; Socotra; World Heritage Site; Yemen","Hadramawt; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Northwest); Socotra; Yemen; Anthozoa; biodiversity; coastal zone; conservation planning; coral; decision making; endemic species; fishing effort; protected area; socioeconomic survey; spatiotemporal analysis; World Heritage Site","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-80155211111"

The decision support tool Marxan is applied to a reef system in the central Philippines where 30 marine protected areas (MPAs) have been established in communities without much use of biophysical data. The intent was to explore how Marxan might assist with the legally required expansion to protect 15% of marine waters, and how existing MPAs might affect that process. Results show that biophysical information alone did not provide much guidance in identifying patterns of conservation importance in areas where the data are poor. Socioeconomic data were needed to distinguish among possible areas for protection; but here, as elsewhere in marine environments, the availability of such data was very limited. In the final analysis, local knowledge and integrated understanding of socioeconomic realities may offer the best spatially explicit information. The 30 existing MPAs, which encompassed a small proportion of the reef system, did not limit future options in developing a suite of MPAs on a broader scale. Rather, they appeared to generate the support for MPAs that is obligatory for any larger zoning effort. In summary, establishing MPAs based on community-driven criteria has biological and social value, but efforts should be made to collect ecological and socioeconomic data to guide the continued creation of MPAs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Determining the ecological factors influencing vegetation is also a basic principle for hierarchical ecological classifications and a necessary prerequisite for ecosystem-based land use planning. Eco-floristic sectors (EFS) have already been identified for the Indonesian island of Sumatra, combining both approaches, dividing it into 38 EFSs representing unique ecosystems in terms of tree flora and environment (Laumonier 1997). The impact of deforestation on individual EFSs has been highly varied and in some cases extreme. We assigned one of five 'extinction risk categories' to each EFS based on the percentage of forest lost between 1985 and 2007. Eighty-five percent of all forest loss (10.2 million ha) occurred in the eastern peneplain, western lowland regions and swamps. In 2007, only 29% of forests were protected by conservation areas, only nine of the 38 EFS had more than 50% of their remaining forest cover protected. 38% of remaining forest was ""critically endangered"", ""endangered"" or ""vulnerable"" EFSs (5 million ha) but only 1 million ha (20%) were protected. Sumatra's existing network of conservation areas does not adequately represent the island's ecosystems. Priorities for a new conservation area network can be formulated for integration into Sumatra's new land use plans at provincial and district level. Decision makers can now use EFSs to locate new conservation areas so they represent and maintain the whole range of the island's diversity. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.","Conservation assessment; Deforestation; Eco-floristic zoning; Sumatra; Threat","Greater Sunda Islands; Sumatra; Sunda Isles; biodiversity; deforestation; extinction risk; floristics; land use planning; prioritization; protected area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77952089584"

State and local agencies in particular, as well as the federal government, need to consider what they will have to do differently if the 100-year flood arrives every decade or so, if the protected areas for threatened species are no longer habitable, or if a region can expect more frequent and more severe wildfires, hurricanes, droughts, water shortages, or other extreme environmental events. Both conceptually and practically, people and organizations will have to adjust what may be life-long assumptions to meet the potential consequences of climate change. How and where should bridges be built? What zoning rules may need to be changed? How can targets for reduced carbon emissions be met? These and myriad other questions will need to be answered in the coming years and decades. Informing Decisions in a Changing Climate examines the growing need for climate-related decision support--that is, organized efforts to produce, disseminate, and facilitate the use of data and information in order to improve the quality and efficacy of climate-related decisions. Drawing on evidence from past efforts to organize science for improved decision making, it develops guidance for government agencies and other institutions that will provide or use information for coping with climate change.

The aim was to determine the sustainability of each field from the fishery (i.e. stocks) and social standpoint (i.e. fishermen). With regard to sustainability, it was generally apparent that the fisheries analyzed are far from any ideal that would permit long-term exploitation, but are nonetheless also distant from the extremes of non-sustainability in the environments investigated. The low degree of organization demonstrated in most fisheries of Pernambuco and the low level of schooling among the fishermen contribute toward maintaining the status quo, with an increase in situations of conflict and a lack of valorization regarding the activities. The shrimp system is the least sustainable, mainly due to its environmental impact; however, this is compensated by the relatively higher quality of living provided stakeholders through its exploitation. The evaluation dimensions showed the most sustainable system in Pernambuco to be the stationary 'uncovered pound net', followed by the line system. Alternative procedures for integrated fishery management, such as an increase in statistical data, coastal zoning to limit shrimp farms and establishing protected areas are proposed and discussed. Such procedures may contribute toward the formulation of public policies for the fishery industry of the state, which is essentially made up of artisanal fisheries with low yields and exercised by the 11 926 fishermen affiliated with coastal fishing colonies. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag.","","Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67549149808"

Boaters (n = 543) visiting the region during the summer completed face-to-face surveys. Results show variability in boater setting preferences, supporting an ROS-based approach to MPA planning and zoning. While boaters as a whole placed the greatest importance on natural settings, sailboat operators expressed stronger preferences for natural and quiet settings relative to motorboats, and motorboat operators expressed stronger preferences for settings characterized by built facilities and extractive activities relative to sailboats. Several marine activities emerged as sources of perceived conflict for boaters, including personal watercraft, commercial whale watching vessels, and shellfish aquaculture.

To inform future research and policy decisions, we reviewed the scientific literature to assess MPA impacts on five indicators of human welfare: food security, resource rights, employment, community organization, and income. Following MPA establishment, food security generally remained stable or increased in older and smaller MPAs. The ability of most fishing groups to govern MPA resources changed. Increased resource rights were positively correlated with MPA zoning and compliance with MPA regulations. Small sample sizes precluded statistical tests of the impacts of MPAs on employment, community organization, and income. Our results demonstrate that MPAs shape the social well-being and political power of fishing communities; impacts (positive and negative) vary within and among social groups; and social impacts are correlated with some-but not all-commonly hypothesized explanatory factors. Accordingly, MPAs may represent a viable strategy for enhancing food security and empowering local communities, but current practices negatively affect at least a minority of fishers. To inform policy making, further research must better document and explain variation in the positive and negative social impacts of MPAs. © 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.","Displacement; Food security; Livelihoods; Marine reserves; National parks; Poverty; Resource rights; Social impacts","Conservation of Natural Resources; Consumer Participation; Employment; Fisheries; Food Supply; Humans; Income; Marine Biology; Oceans and Seas; compliance; decision making; employment; fishing community; food security; hypothesis testing; income; marine park; national park; policy making; political power; poverty; research work; social impact; article; catering service; consumer; economics; employment; environmental protection; food industry; human; income; marine biology; methodology; sea; statistics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77957140306"

The goal of this work was to evaluate the implication of the compliance with the Forest Code for reducing areas of sugarcane production in the State of São Paulo, aiming to estimate the upper limit of potential losses that the application of the Forest Code could bring to the economic viability of important sectors of Brazilian agricultural production. We analyzed 23 projects of environmental planning carried out in 1,961 landholdings of sugarcane mills from São Paulo State, which totalized 533,097 ha (9.7% of the cultivated area with sugarcane in the state). In these projects, we carried out an environmental zoning of Permanent Protected Areas (PPA), lands of agricultural production, and potential lands to constitute Legal Reserves. The results indicated that, on average, 10.4% of the total area of each farm was classified as PPA, and that only 21.2% of PPA area (2.2% of the total area) were occupied by some kind of agricultural production. Sugarcane occupied, in average, 12.1% of the areas classified as PPA (1.2% of the total area). Overall, 76.5% of the total area of projects was occupied by sugarcane fields and the sum of potential areas for compliance with the Legal Reserve, which were constituted by forest remnants (5.0% of total area), abandoned lands (2.3% of total area), and lands with other uses (6.3% of total area), would result in 13.6% of the total area and consequently generate a deficit of 6.4% of lands for the full compliance with the Legal Reserve (20%). This deficit could even be compensated, by law, outside the landholding register in landscapes with lower agriculture suitability. Therefore, the diagnostics presented in this work for the sugarcane sector in the State of São Paulo indicates that compliance with the current Forest Code would not reduce agricultural production, which highlight that part of the arguments that are favorable for changes in the Forest Code need to be revisited in the light of concrete data and in a less speculative way.","Environmental planning; Environmental policy; Forest restoration; Land use; Riparian areas","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79952283726"

Of many possible alternatives proposed to minimize these effects, the functional zoning (or TRIAD) approach is gaining popularity in North America. The goal of this approach is to minimize the negative environmental impacts of forestry while maintain timber supply by dividing the forest into three broad land-use zones: (1) conservation, (2) ecosystem management, and (3) wood production. In this study, we used a spatially explicit landscape model to simulate the effects of fire and six different forest management scenarios on a boreal mixedwood forest management unit in central Quebec. The management scenarios examined included the current practices scenario, a scenario proposed by the provincial government, and four TRIAD scenarios varying in the amount of forest allocated to each of the three zones. For each scenario, we examined the harvest volume, percentage old-growth forest or old forest managed to favour old-growth attributes, and effective mesh size of forest patches by 20-year age classes. With more area set aside for conservation and high-retention partial cut harvesting techniques designed to maintain the attributes of old-growth stands, all TRIAD scenarios resulted in higher percentages of stands with old-growth attributes than the current practices scenario and the government proposed scenario, and two of the four TRIAD scenarios also resulted in higher harvest volume over the long term. All forest management scenarios resulted in significantly lower effective mesh size than the fire-only scenario, but this difference was not as pronounced for the four TRIAD scenarios as for the current practice and government proposed scenarios. We conclude that the TRIAD approach has the potential to minimize some of the negative impacts of forestry on the landscape, while maintaining timber supply over the long term. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A phenomenon of expanding demand for ocean space as a resource that is in limited supply is most pronounced in coastal marine environments. Intense competition for ocean space among human users in near-shore waters leads inevitably to disputes. Because the private ownership of ocean space usually is unauthorized, ocean space may be allocated through collective action. Present practice involves the political allocation of ocean space for specific purposes; such allocations are known as ocean zoning. The essential characteristics of an ocean zone are a boundary and a set of rules that identify the types and regulate the extent of activities that can occur inside the boundary. Depending upon the nature of the activities involved, an ocean zone may be designated exclusively for a specific use, or it may permit multiple uses. The delimitation of a zone is inherently an economic decision that reveals societal preferences for the production of goods and services from the ocean. In the future, as human uses of the ocean proliferate, and as technologies reduce the costs of establishing and enforcing legal interests, we may begin to see the development of markets for allocating ocean space. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Of these, a seed cell selection procedure works by evaluating potential cells for protection one by one, picking the one that maximizes the objective function, adding seed cells. This continues to full protection of the project area. The other is a Monte Carlo approach, which uses a likelihood sampling procedure based on weighted importance layers of conservation interest to evaluate alternative protected area sizing and placement. This is similar to the objective function of Marxan, a priority-selection decision-support tool based on optimization algorithms using geographic information system data. The two approaches are alternative options in a common spatial optimization module, which uses the time- and spatial-dynamic Ecospace model for the evaluations. The optimizations are implemented as components of the Ecopath with Ecosim approach and software. In a case study, we find that there can be protected area zoning that will accommodate economical and social factors, without causing ecological deterioration. We also find a tradeoff between including cells of special conservation interest, and the economic and social interests.

Typically, these management strategies require the collection and integration of ecological and socioeconomic data. This problem is illustrated by a case study of Koh Chang National Marine Park, Thailand. Biophysical surveys assessed coral communities in the MPA to derive indices of reef diversity and vulnerability. Social surveys assessed visitor perceptions and satisfaction with conditions encountered on snorkelling tours. Notably, increased coral mortality caused a significant decrease in visitor satisfaction. The two studies were integrated to prescribe zoning and ""Limits of Acceptable Change"" (LAC). As a biophysical indicator, the data suggest a LAC value of 0.35 for the coral mortality index. As a social indicator, the data suggest that a significant fraction of visitors would find a LAC value of under 30 snorkellers per site as acceptable. The draft zoning plan prescribed four different types of zones: (I) a Conservation Zone with no access apart from monitoring or research; (II) Tourism Zones with high tourism intensities at less vulnerable reefs; (III) Ecotourism zones with a social LAC standard of <30 snorkellers per site, and (IV) General Use Zones to meet local artisanal fishery needs.

The plan created several closed areas or harvest refugia in which consumptive activities are prohibited. This research reports results of surveys that we conducted with members of three stakeholder groups in the Florida Keys: commercial fishers, dive operators, and members of local environmental groups. Surveys requested responses regarding the information sources individuals tapped when learning of the zoning plan and the FKNMS; their degree of public participation; their perceptions and acceptance of the zoning strategy and the process of its design; and the expected outcomes of the zoning strategy. Many responses show significant differences among the three groups. Fishers felt highly alienated from the process of zone designation and displayed a sense of anger and powerlessness with respect to what they considered to be an attempt to exclude their group from the harvest refugia. Dive operators demonstrated the highest levels of participation in the designation process, but were concerned that refugia regulations could limit their activities in the future. Members of environmental groups were the strongest supporters of the harvest refugia concept and the FKNMS. This research suggests numerous ways in which marine resource managers could improve their public outreach and information dissemination strategies when developing future harvest refugia and marine protected areas.

During the preparation of the draft zoning plan in 2000, societal data on two conflicting park user groups-recreational scuba divers and fishers (anglers)-was collected. While conflict resolution was a plan priority, other factors, such as cumulative environmental impacts of users and protection for the critically endangered grey nurse shark (Carcharias taurus), further complicated planning. Both scuba diving and angling are primary summer activities and are disproportionately concentrated around the headlands of the bay. Furthermore, shore based game-fishing was concentrated on the northern headland, where the conflict was centered. However, when the exact locations of divers and anglers were determined, there was a partial partitioning of the available space, with only a small contested overlap. To resolve conflict and maximize positive environmental outcomes, a sanctuary zone and noanchoring zone option in the draft zoning plan was sought to formalize this partition. The human dimension data proved valuable in guiding environmental management in this politically volatile situation. A baseline study conducted 11 years previously was also used to gain a limited perspective on change in user numbers. Comparison between study periods indicated dive numbers had remained similar, while the number of dive charter trips was significantly less. The numbers of anglers, for the four months compared, had doubled and tripled.

As one of the nation's foremost university teaching and research stations, the biological station is an exemplary biosphere reserve by several criteria. It provides nearly unique research and educational functions including state-of-the-art facilities for studying soils, atmospheric chemistry, and stream biology. The reserve therefore succeeds at addressing the overarching goal of studying human effects on the biosphere, as well as several other objectives of the Man and Biosphere Programme. Several of its projects and programs have led to the creation of important regional organizations that address critical needs in science education and watershed management, and thus the reserve has also achieved significant public outreach and education. By other criteria, however, it is lacking. The biological station follows some but not all of the zoning criteria proposed by Man and Biosphere. Several management plans have been prepared by student groups, but there was no assessment of them nor were alternatives developed. The biological station's Land Use Committee has met rarely over the past several decades, and there is no process in place to assess managerial options or perform outreach with local landowners. Based on this analysis, we make several recommendations about the management of the reserve and about assessing other biosphere reserves for their conformity to the international standards. The University of Michigan Biological Station is in need of an approved management plan that assesses potential areas for acquisition and explores and refines the zoning currently in place. A modest, ongoing public outreach program is also proposed.","Biosphere reserves; Man and Biosphere Programme; Protected area management; University of Michigan Biological Station","biosphere; ecosystem management; protected area","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0038138102"

MPAs have been most often designated to protect benthic habitats and their biota. Increasingly, there is a need to account for highly mobile pelagic taxa, such as marine birds, mammals and turtles, and their oceanic habitats. For breeding seabirds foraging from a central place, particular attention should be paid to distant foraging grounds and movement corridors, which can often extend to hundreds of kilometers from breeding colonies. We assessed the habitat use by the most threatened Mediterranean seabird, the Balearic Shearwater, Puffinus mauretanicus, using vessel-based surveys during the chick-rearing period (May-June). We used a hierarchical modeling approach to identify those environmental variables that most accurately reflected the oceanographic habitat of this species by (1) delineating its foraging range using presence/absence data and (2) identifying important foraging grounds where it concentrates in dense aggregations. The foraging range comprised the frontal systems along the eastern Iberian continental shelf waters (depth <200 m) and areas close to the breeding colonies in the Balearic Islands. Shearwaters aggregated in productive shelf areas with elevated chlorophyll a concentrations. Following the model of a core-buffer MPA, we envisioned those areas of dense aggregation (i.e., the area of influence of the Ebro River discharge and Cape La Nao regions) as the core regions deserving elevated protection and more stringent management. More diffuse protective measures would be applied within the larger buffer region, delineated by the foraging range of the species. Marine zoning measures can greatly benefit the conservation of the Balearic Shearwater and other far-ranging seabirds by extending protective measures beyond their breeding colonies during both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Balearic Shearwater; Conservation; Habitat modeling; MPAs; Oceanography; Puffinus mauretanicus; Remote sensing; ROC curves; Seabird-fishery interactions","Animals; Birds; Demography; Ecosystem; Mediterranean Sea; Models, Biological; Atlantic Ocean; Balearic Islands; Cape La Nao; Ebro River; Eurasia; Europe; Iberian Shelf; Mediterranean Sea; Southern Europe; Spain; Aves; Mammalia; Procellariidae; Procellariiformes; Puffinus mauretanicus; Testudines; endangered species; marine environment; marine park; seabird; species conservation; animal; article; biological model; bird; demography; ecosystem; Mediterranean Sea; physiology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33749548199"

Our findings contributed to the overall design process, along with our summary of other general principles of marine reserve design. Extensive stakeholder input provided information concerning the resources and their patterns of use. These inputs also contributed to the reserve design process.

Systematic, objective approaches to site selection and design can help reconcile conflicting interests, represent stakeholders' viewpoints fairly and evenly, and extend the scope of planning studies from single reserves to networks. We illustrate the use of spatial multiple-criteria analysis for determining the suitability of marine areas for different uses and levels of protection. This technique couples geographic information systems (GIS) for land assessment and evaluation with a formal statement of the design priorities as seen from the different viewpoints of all involved stakeholders. The planning process, while staying focused on the main purposes of conservation and feasibility, involves all the main interest groups in the definition of priorities so that conflicts and tensions are kept under control. We used multiple-criteria analysis to integrate objective data with the contrasting priorities of different stakeholders in the planning of a marine protected area. The results of the analysis can be used to define an optimal spatial arrangement of different protection levels. As a case study, we developed a zoning plan for one of the first marine protected areas in Italy, the Asinara Island National Marine Reserve.","","Italy; marine ecosystem; protected area; spatial analysis; zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036229094"

In this context, marine protected areas (MPAs) and artificial reefs (ARs) are increasingly regarded as interesting management measures, in that they contribute to ecosystem conservation, fisheries sustainability, and because they can be helpful in zoning coastal areas in order to reduce conflicts between users. Beyond these expected benefits, it is important to appraise whether MPAs and ARs meet managers' objectives. This review focuses on the interaction between ecological sciences and management in the purpose of establishing or monitoring MPAs and ARs. We first study how objectives have to be formalized through management plans, and which kinds of information need to be collected in this respect. We then report management objectives related to MPAs and ARs, and list corresponding observed effects.

However, much remains to be researched, especially concerning managed ecosystems. Costa Rica has approximately 25% of its area under some conservation regime; many of these protected areas, especially in and near urban areas, are under private ownership and management. Among these is the regime of the protected zones (PZ) that seeks to protect watershed resources. The achievement of conservation objectives in these areas will not only depend on ecological conditions but also on social and economic ones. This framework provides a good field in which to explore the interrelations between sustainability and ecosystem health. This study summarizes the work I participated in the last three years at the Center for Sustainable Development Studies in Costa Rica. We developed a holistic ecosystem health indicator (HEHI) for managed ecosystems. This indicator was tested several times in seven PZs in the east, south, and west sections of the central valley of Costa Rica. The evaluation tool includes measurements of productivity, organization, and resilience of the ecosystems. These were combined with social indicators and resource use patterns from the communities surrounding the PZs studied. The use of this indicator and the conclusions of this project could justify the use of an integral approach to address conservation problems in developing nations. The creation and management of these protected areas should be the result of a combined effort between community organizations and government agencies dealing with land distribution, zoning, and public health, among others.","","Costa Rica; ecosystem health; ecosystem management; sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032977178"

There are fundamental differences between the principles and practices underpinning the implementation of MPAs and fisheries management. This paper analyses the interactions between these two approaches to natural resource management and highlights the difficulties in integrating them effectively. The major challenges for governments are: poor cooperation between fisheries and conservation agencies; in principle inconsistencies between allocation of fishing rights by fisheries agencies and loss of these rights through MPA declaration; re-allocation of resources between user groups through spatial zoning; lack of fisheries expertise in conservation planning, and inappropriate single-species/single-issue approach to fisheries management. As fisheries agencies are now considering developing their own MPAs as tools for fisheries management, the need to address inconsistencies between conservation and fisheries approaches to the spatial management of natural resources increases further. Better collaboration between government agencies and better coordination of their activities would help more effective and less conflicting management of marine resources. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biodiversity conservation; Fisheries management; Fishing rights; Marine protected areas; Spatial","Australasia; Australia; Eastern Hemisphere; World; conservation; fishery management; natural resource; protected area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-13844297448"

The liberation of Prespa, a remote and rather socially isolated borderline area, from Ottoman occupation took place in 1912-13. Recent events in its environmental history have been forest clearings and human depopulation in the Civil War (1944-49), irrigation system construction in the 1960s, its 'discovery' by ornithologists in the late 1960s, the high emigration rates of 1960-1980, its designation as a National Park in 1974, the destructive development works of 1984-86 after Greece's entry to the EEC and the conversion to intensive bean cultivation in the mid 1980s. The human population of ca 7000 at the start of this century suffered an almost 80% decrease after the Civil War. A resettlement in the mid 1950s increased the population by 40% but in the 1970s emigration reduced it to its previous size of around 1500, still its present size. The extensive and diverse farming systems of previous centuries changed gradually after the construction of an irrigation network in the 1960s, which twenty years later and along with international changes in production and economy patterns, made possible the present day domination of a bean monoculture within irrigated croplands. This was accompanied by increased energy inputs, mechanisation and the use of chemicals. Intensification of agriculture brought increased incomes which attracted also livestock keepers, resulting in a 56% decrease in numbers of livestock in 1964-1993. Cattle are presently kept for meat production only. They graze on the mountains, and no longer in the meadows around the lakeshore. A local shorthorn breed accounting for 93% of all cattle in 1963 declined to less than 18% in 1993. Fishing aimed mainly at carp and Prespa bleak, continues today as in the past to be a source of supplementary income. Eighty-six per cent of the mainly oak and beech - forests are State owned and the rest belong to local municipalities. The forest area has not changed essentially in the last 40 years, but forest roads have expanded. Forests provide mainly fuelwood for local needs and small quantities of industrial timber. No specific management is conducted to safeguard the conservation values of the forest, the majority of which consists of even aged coppiced stands with limited value for wildlife. Manufacturing never played an important role for the economy of the area. Tourism has increased in the last 20 years, concentrated mainly in summer and spring. Accommodation in the villages is not yet satisfactory though it has improved enormously in recent years. The National Park's infrastructure for visitors remains poor. Tourist pressure generally is not yet that high to impact drastically the social and environmental fabric. In places, hunting, angling and poaching can negatively affect the target species. The construction of the irrigation network in the eastern part of Lake Mikri Prespa was the most important change to the landscape and the habitats of Prespa the last 30 years. It resulted in the embankment of free-flowing streams, drainage of wet meadows and dramatic reduction of trees and hedges. In the last 15 years, the reedbeds, no longer burnt or mowed and assisted by increased nutrient loadings from agricultural runoff, have expanded landward to occupy formerly open, periodically flooded, areas. The above changes in habitats and land use have brought an impoverishment of biodiversity which can be seen in the extermination or the decrease in the numbers of certain plant and bird species. The problems preventing a better management of the National Park and the perpetuation of its values are inappropriate legislation, the poor degree of coordination of the public services, the lack of both a specific National Park Service in Greece and a management authority for the Park and the hostile attitude of local people due to their limited information and involvement. The scenic beauty, the wetlands and a number of rare habitats, the diversity of habitats, flora and fauna, the endemic life forms, the rare mammals and the colonial waterbirds, the local architecture and the cultural expressions such as the Byzantine monuments, are the values of Prespa that must be preserved as a whole. The initial conservation efforts aimed at preserving biodiversity but later it became apparent that not only are humans an inseparable part of the whole, but additionally, several of their extensive activities have contributed substantially to the rich biodiversity of the area. Through the prerequisites of keeping a balance between primary and tertiary sector activities and of revitalizing the social fabric, the following are the key management and conservation issues of today: an unequivocal agreement on the values to be preserved and their limits; the formation of a management authority; a new realistic protection and land use zoning; the diversification and extensification of all farming activities; the restoration of the wet meadow habitats; the ensuring of a high water level and a good water quality for both lakes through tri-lateral cooperation between Greece, Albania and FYROM; and the establishment of a permanent environmental monitoring scheme. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Biodiversity conservation; Cultural landscapes; Ecological integrity; Ecosystem management; Greece; Human ecology; Integrated management approach; National park management; Prespa; Protected area management; Wetland conservation; Wetland management","Greece, Prespa National Park; Alburnus alburnus; Aves; Bos taurus; Cyprinus carpio; Fagus; Mammalia; Phaseolus (angiosperm); Quercus; environmental management; native conservation; protected area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030817352"

The new marine park zoning implements, in a quantitative manner, many of the theoretical design principles discussed in the literature. For example, the new network of no-take areas has at least 20% protection per ""bioregion,"" minimum levels of protection for all known habitats and special or unique features, and minimum sizes for no-take areas of at least 10 or 20 km across at the smallest diameter. Overall, more than 33% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is now in no-take areas (previously 4.5%). The steps taken leading to this outcome were to clarify to the interested public why the existing level of protection was inadequate; detail the conservation objectives of establishing new no-take areas; work with relevant and independent experts to define, and contribute to, the best scientific process to deliver on the objectives; describe the biodiversity (e.g., map bioregions); define operational principles needed to achieve the objectives; invite community input on all of the above; gather and layer the data gathered in round-table discussions; report the degree of achievement of principles for various options of no-take areas; and determine how to address negative impacts. Some of the key success factors in this case have global relevance and include focusing initial communication on the problem to be addressed; applying the precautionary principle; using independent experts; facilitating input to decision making; conducting extensive and participatory consultation; having an existing marine park that encompassed much of the ecosystem; having legislative power under federal law; developing high-level support; ensuring agency priority and ownership; and being able to address the issue of displaced fishers. ©2005 Society for Conservation Biology.","Biophysical operational principles; Cultural operational principles; Economic operational principles; Reserve-design software; Social operational principles","Australasia; Australia; Great Barrier Reef Marine Park; Queensland; biodiversity; conservation management; marine ecosystem; protected area; reserve design","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33244464260"

Considerable progress has been made in the establishment of MPAs in both developing and developed nations, but the formulation and implementation of management plans has lagged behind. Funding, expertise, and lack of information have constrained planning and management of MPAs in several tropical nations. Despite the promotion of ecologically sustainable development and the involvement of local communities or stakeholders within protected areas, few countries incorporate these principles in the management of MPAs. Tropical MPAs are considered to be of limited success by area managers. Several interrelated factors, such as strategic planning and reliance on coastal resources and zoning schemes, may influence the success of these areas. © 1996 Taylor & Francis.","Marine parks; Marine protected areas; Tropical","Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Public policy; Strategic planning; Zoning; Marine parks; Marine protected areas (MPA); marine park; marine parks; marine protected area; protected area; protected resources; tropical environment; Coastal zones","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030114731"

Hunters claimed thousands, yet populations persisted. In the past century, because of habitat loss and prey depletion, coupled with the recent demand for traditional medicines, tiger populations have been reduced to a few hundred individuals. As a first step toward long-term planning for tigers, and to guide efforts to increase protected area coverage, the Myanmar government in 1998 initiated a project to develop a revised National Tiger Action Plan. Extensive surveys confirmed tigers in only 4 of 17 survey locations. Significant populations are thought to persist in the far North and far South of the country, where large, intact forests offer the potential for tiger recovery. With partnerships and collaborations, tiger populations can be protected in the short term (<5 years) by expanding protected areas and corridors, mobilizing enforcement staff to reduce poaching of tigers and prey, and amending existing wildlife legislation in accordance with international laws. Over the long term (5-20 years), recovery of Myanmar's tiger populations will depend on increasing support from local people, zoning tiger areas to reduce habitat loss and disturbance, and maintaining connectivity of existing national and transboundary forests.

Some 200 million cubic metres of wood are harvested every year in Canada, generating numerous economic offshoots in the various regions of the country, including almost 300 000 direct jobs, even without counting recreational and tourism activities. Yet in many parts of the country the allowable cut has already been reached and serious wood shortages are predicted within 25 years, despite the annual reforestation operations carried out in all provinces. The situation is critical since there is growing pressure from society to increase protected areas; to modify forestry practices to protect biodiversity; and to maintain more old-growth forests within forests managed for wood production. In addition, there is a prospect that future climate change could increase the frequency of fire and insect outbreaks, further reducing the quantity of wood fibre available for harvesting. This article proposes the adoption of a type of zoning principle to help deal with these new challenges and achieve sustainable management of Canadian forests. The approach would be to set aside different areas of forest for full protection and varying levels of management intensity for productive purposes.","","Canada; North America; Insecta; environmental protection; forest ecosystem; forest management; plantation; timber harvesting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1942472460"

These areas, discussed in the 1995 Draft Management Plan, disallowed all extractive activities, and four of the zones also prohibited diving and snorkeling. Furthermore, the Draft Management Plan considered recreational carrying capacity, proposing that use densities be studied and eventually limited in high-use and sensitive areas. Conducted with 62 commercial dive operators from the Florida Keys in 1995-96, this study uses geographic information systems (GIS) to determine the extent of FKNMS zone use by dive operators, assess the regional importance of FKNMS zones to operators, and compare management strategies by which to allow use while minimizing impacts to the coral reef resource. Dive operators took almost 70% of their total trips and 77% of their total divers to FKNMS zones in 1995. Although zone use is generally related to the proximity of dive locations, dive operators do rely disproportionately on single sites in certain regions. The resulting profiles demonstrate that management strategies need to consider disproportionate use, as well as the average number of users per trip, to effectively protect the region's environmental resources. In addition to implementing a carrying capacity plan, the FKNMS should consider a limited-entry system for dive operators.","Carrying capacity; Diving; Florida Keys; GIS; Marine zoning; MPAs","United States; Anthozoa; diving; GIS; protected area; zoning system; article; diving; environmental protection; law; marine environment; recreation; United States","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034024475"

The growth in numbers of protected areas was slow until after World War II, when most of the present national parks and reserves were established. Environmental changes detrimental to wildlife have been especially severe during the last 40 years. Some statistics are presented and the consequences for wildlife listed. In recent years public concern and interest in the rural environment has increased although this has also led to many more visitors to protected areas. Uncontrolled public use can cause damage to fragile vegetation and disturbance to animal life may interfere with breeding success. Multiple use of national parks and other protected areas for wildlife protection and public recreation requires careful control. Zoning is used to separate the two functions but in general it is better to create areas primarily for wildlife and others for public recreation. The importance of the voluntary conservation organisations is stressed: they are independent of government policy but act as advisers on the selection of state reserves as well as establishing their own.

For instance, effort is homogenously distributed over areas from which subsets of reserves are chosen. I tested this and other model assumptions with a case study of the multiple-use Jervis Bay Marine Park. Prior to zoning of the park I conducted 166 surveys of the park's recreational fisheries, plotting the location of 16,009 anglers. I converted these plots into diagrams of fishing effort and analyzed correlates between fishing and habitat and the effect of two reserve designs - the draft and final zoning plans of the park - on the 15 fisheries observed. Fisheries were strongly correlated with particular habitats and had negatively skewed and often bimodal spatial distribution. The second mode of intensely fished habitat could be 6 SD greater than the fishery's mean allocation of effort by area. In the draft-zoning plan, sanctuary zone (no-take) area and potential subduction of fishing effort were similar. In the final plan, which was altered in response to public comment, the area of sanctuary zone increased, and the impact on fishing effort decreased. In only one case was a fishery's most intensely targeted location closed to fishing. Because of the discriminating manner with which fishers target habitats, if simple percentage targets are used for planning, sanctuary location can be adjusted to avoid existing fishing effort. According to modeled outcomes, the implication of this may be diminished reserve effectiveness.

In the geopark construction by UNESCO, geological heritage protection was closely combined with promotion of sustainable development of local economy, which has become the best way to protect the geological heritage. The geological heritages in Xinjiang are great in quantity, vary in type and excellent in grade. The complicated geologic-geomorphic environment decided the type and spatial distribution of the geological heritages in Xinjiang, where the main types are geologic/geomorpohologic landscapes and water landforms. The spatial distribution can be divided into five geological heritage provinces, i.e., the Altai, Zhunggar, Tianshan, Tarim and Kunlun-Altun, among which Tianshan and Kunlun-Altun are most important. According to the first systematical investigation of the geological heritage in Xinjiang, it is confirmed that poor coordination between protection and development is the basic reason for the falling behind situation in geological heritage protection. Six major protection steps are identified, that is, protection type, protection form, protection mode, protection grade, protection priority scheduling and protection zoning. At the same time the optimal-selection thought, which integrates geopark with geological heritage protection area and other dependent territories as well as five modes are put forward. Therefore, the protection and development reserve list of 209 important geological heritages in Xinjiang is constructed.","Distribution characteristic; Geological heritage; Protection and development; Xinjiang","Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Xinjiang Uygur; environmental geology; environmental protection; geomorphology; heritage conservation; protected area; spatial distribution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33744947971"

The catch is dominated by Tridacna spp. and Octopus spp. Within the Nabq Managed Resource Protected Area, on the southern Gulf of Aqaba coast, a network of no-take zones (NTZs) was established (in 1995) to promote sustainable management of finfish stocks. Since this zoning also applied to exploitation of invertebrates, surveys of large species of molluscs and echinoderms across selected NTZs and adjacent fished areas were conducted (over 2000-2002) to assess any effects of gathering. Pooled data from all three years showed significantly higher abundances of Tridacna and Tectus dentatus in the NTZs, with greater abundances occurring at the reef edge zone. Size-frequency distributions revealed both a greater size range of Tridacna and a greater mean size of both Tridacna and Te. dentatus, within the NTZs, as compared to the fished areas. The size-frequency distribution of gleaned Tridacna, determined from discarded shells, also showed a smaller size range than did live Tridacna within the NTZs. By contrast, holothurians, which are not currently exploited by the local Bedouin, showed greater abundance in fished areas than in NTZs. Large diadematid sea urchins, along with the non-commercial strombs, Strombus gibberulus and Strombus fasciatus, were also significantly more abundant within fished areas, an effect presumed due to reduced predation pressure from fish as a result of fishing. Within the fished areas, there was a positive relationship between local abundance of Tridacna and of diadematids, thought to be due to high densities of the urchins acting as a deterrent against gathering. The establishment of NTZs has led to significant differences in invertebrate populations between take zones (TZ) and no-take zones. However, since there can be little or no spillover of adults of less mobile or sedentary invertebrates from NTZs to fished areas, any benefit to the fishery will depend largely on the greater larval production and export from protected populations. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The integration of biodiversity aspects into cross-sectoral policies is a core of the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international commitments, and has been adopted by the UK government. One of the most important ways of conserving biological diversity is to maintain and restore characteristic regional features. To assist this, there is a need to zone the country, because measures appropriate for nature conservation and farming in one region could easily be inappropriate for both in another. Eight broad land-type zones in Great Britain are identified to enable linking of national and international land-use policies and regional practices, particularly agricultural, to the wildlife interest that these affect. These zones are based on environmentally imposed potential, rather than actual land-use or vegetation cover. The zones should therefore have some stability. The distribution of these zones is compared with the distributions of bird assemblages to illustrate their relevance to nature conservation. As a pointer to future work needs, examples of main actual and potential nature conservation interest in each zone are linked to farming enterprises and the agricultural policies which underlie these. © 1995 Elsevier Science Limited.

Densities of the most valuable fishery resource, sea cucumbers, were three times higher in zones that remained open to fishing compared to 'no-take' conservation zones, and densities of sharks were five times higher in tourism zones than fishing or conservation zones. These results highlight bias in the socio-political processes that can accompany selection of marine protected areas, where fishers attempt to minimize perceived impacts on their livelihood by locating large protected zones in resource-poor areas, and tourism operators and sport divers argue for protection of areas containing atypically-interesting features.

At the 3.4 km long reef of Eilat (Red Sea), a small (ca. 350 m of coastline) enclosure strategy has been enforced since 1992, while the remaining reef was left open to intense human activities. Here we have investigated for 2.5 y three populations of the branching coral Stylophora pistillata (3605 colonies) in a locality within the enclosed area (site NR) and in two areas open to the public, by tossing random quadrats at the shallow lagoonar zone (0.5-1.5 m depth). In the two open sites we found significantly higher levels of colony breakage (14-34% vs. 4-9% in the enclosed site), lower partial mortality levels of colonies (in the first 1.5 y; 7-9% vs. 23-30% at NR), higher recruitment (up to 3.0 vs. up to 0.9 colonies/m 2), 50% reduction in coral life span (10 vs. 20 y) and an estimated extinction period of 9-10 y for new cohorts as compared to >20 y in the enclosed site. Average colony size and maximal colony size were about half in the open sites. Live coverage fluctuated widely in all sites but was 3 times higher in the enclosed area (1.0-3.0% vs. 0.3-1.1%). Log-transformed size frequency distributions revealed, at the open sites, a shift from small towards medium-size classes and at the enclosed site, a shift from larger to medium size classes. We conclude that the enclosure of a limited core zone, although improved some ecological parameters, was not sufficient to compensate for stress imposed by anthropogenic activities. It is suggested to employ active restoration approaches, such as the ""gardening concept"", as supplementary management tools. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Silviculture is a component of forest management that refers to the suite of stand-level activities used to control stand composition and growth. Intensive forest management (IFM) is a concept that has been discussed and considered in Ontario for at least 30 years. Originally, it referred to an intensively managed forest in which most stands are subject to relatively intensive silvicultural practices. Over time, both professional foresters and stakeholders began using the term IFM as if it were synonymous with intensive silviculture. As a result, IFM has been inappropriately used to reference stand-level activities in several published definitions and key policy documents, creating confusion among the science community, professionals, and the public. This confusion has made it difficult to implement aspects of the 1999 Ontario Forest Accord, which calls for the use of IFM (meaning intensive silviculture) to increase forest growth and productivity in some areas to offset the withdrawal of lands for parks and protected areas. We call on forest managers to refer to the term IFM correctly and to portray forest management to stakeholders as consisting of a portfolio of natural and/or anthropogenic disturbance regimes. With this approach, forest managers could more meaningfully define the intensity of forest management and silviculture on their landbase.","Forest policy; Forest Research Partnership; Intensive silviculture; Land use planning; NEBIE Plot Network; Portfolio concept of forest management; Triad principle of land-use zoning","Ecosystems; Forestry; Management; Canada; North America; Ontario; Ecosystems; Industrial management; Managers; Public policy; Forest policy; Forest Research Partnership; Intensive silviculture; Land use planning; NEBIE Plot Network; Portfolio concept of forest management; forest management; forest product; silviculture; stand structure; Forestry","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33750063198"

Multiple-use zoning can help to balance human uses with conservation goals. Developing effective zoning plans requires information on the condition and uses of marine resources and the conflicts among them. Through interviews and participant observation, we investigated residents' reliance on nearshore fisheries in Ko Chang Marine National Park, a designated ""no-take"" area in eastern Thailand. Approximately 25% of households depended on fishing as their main source of income, with boat owners earning average net wages of 7-68 US$/ day in small-scale fisheries. Apparently unaware of restrictions on resource use, small-scale fishers reported working in 95% of the park's marine waters. Understanding the needs and usage patterns of small-scale fishers will help to inform management and zoning plans for Ko Chang and provide a valuable example for other parks in the region.

The chemicals of concern (COCs) at the site included relatively low levels of mono-and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated aliphatics, as well as other volatile and semivolatile compounds. Direct human exposure scenarios were the key to the mitigation of risks related to soils because the groundwater migration pathway was already interrupted using groundwater recovery. A focused remedial strategy was developed to ensure that the exposure pathways (inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact) are alleviated and the remedial measures are protective to the workers operating and/or maintaining the site. The risk evaluation process included a preliminary risk assessment (Tier 1) based on a comparison with pertinent soil cleanup criteria, a prioritization analysis to rank zones, chemicals and pathways of concern, and an application of the Risk Based Corrective Action (RBCA) approach (Tier 2) for construction worker exposure scenario. The risk assessment identified selected areas that would benefit from remedial actions. Prioritization Analysis classified the site into five high-priority (comprising 97% of the total health-based risk), three medium-priority (contributing to remaining 2 to 3% of the risk), and adequately protected areas. The boundaries and volumes of affected areas were delineated based on confirmatory soil sampling and statistical analyses. The remedial technologies selected for the site have achieved appropriate reduction in risk to comply with all State regulations and include (in addition to the institutional controls): • Capping the site where only immobile semivolatile contaminants are present • Excavation and on-site treatment of the soils impacted by volatile organic compounds through ex situ low temperature desorption, or alternative ""biopile"" treatment and natural attenuation, and • Excavation and off-site disposal of limited volumes of soils This risk-based, integral approach helped identify the real significance of contamination present at the site and facilitated the development of suitable and adequate remedies. Had not it been for this approach, the mere comparison with soil cleanup criteria would have unnecessarily resulted in denoting all areas as nuisance contributors, and thus requiring some actions. New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) has approved this approach and contributed to its accomplishment.","Chemical manufacturing; Industrial site; Risk-based zoning; Soil remediation","environmental management; environmental protection; exposure; polluted soil; remediation; soil pollution control; soil treatment; United States; water contamination","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033627360"

The first meetings between sectors were held in the mid-1990s where the responsibilities of management were agreed upon and from which a number of memorandums were initiated as part of the integrative process that was lead by the Coast Development Authority. Two integrated coastal management (ICM) pilot projects started in the mid- to late 1990s were undertaken to test the effectiveness of the process in two tourist beaches north of Mombasa and later Diani. These ICM programs primarily focused on infrastructural development and resource access issues and participants needed to be reminded that that the objectives of the ICM process were to improve natural resource management and protect biodiversity. There was also the problem that government and the larger economic interests were involved in policy and planning but the poor and associated communities were often marginalized because they lacked effective formal organizations and finances to represent them. The financial support for projects prior to 2003 was generally less than US $150 000 and this and the poverty of the institutions and difficulties of establishing financial sustainability limited the programs and their problem solving. Nonetheless, there has been sustained progress and lessons learned concerning interactions with stakeholders, zoning of activities, linkages among groups, and improvements in the environment that should form the basis for further integration and solutions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This implies that all components - natural and physical, but also cultural and visual - upon which landscape quality is assessed, ought to be considered and studied globally. Natural resources and cultural heritage, however, are usually considered independently when developing protected areas management plans. Here, we present a methodology developed for the Monte da Guia management plan, which allows the interrelated analysis of landscape factors such as geology, geomorphology, pedology, flora and vegetation cover as well as the cultural and visual characters. Using the concepts of biophysical sensitivity and visual quality, we evaluated the relevance of these various factors for the determination of the state of equilibrium/degradation of a landscape, and hence for its conservation value.

The aim of this study was to establish whether herbivores impact recruitment in populations of the species. In particular, we want to compare the herbivore effect in non-protected populations with protected populations inside a national park. We compared demographic features and the regeneration process in four populations, two located inside and two outside the park. We expect populations inside the park to exhibit a significantly greater recruitment, expressed in seedling establishment and survival, relative to those outside the park. Outside the park, livestock predation on fruits and herbivory on seedlings could hamper recruitment. However, fruit and seedling predation was similarly high both inside and outside the park, posing a significant constraint on the regeneration of B. miersii. The main associated causes were the presence of livestock and seedling desiccation. If the survival of B. miersii is to be achieved, managing livestock pressure, possibly through zoning, seems mandatory. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Beilschmiedia miersii; Chile; Herbivory; Protected areas; Seedling establishment","Chile; conservation status; endangered species; herbivory; introduced species; regeneration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035111057"

We assessed the significance of these protected areas to albatrosses by: (i) documenting commuting flights between Hawaiian breeding sites and the California Current System (CCS); (ii) quantifying albatross dispersion patterns on the central California continental shelf and slope, and (iii) characterizing albatross habitats within sanctuary waters using concurrent satellite-tracking data and vessel-based sightings. Chick-rearing albatrosses commuted from their colony on Tern Island, Hawaii (23.878°N, 166.288°W), to the CCS (34-48°N) and two of the eight satellite-tracked birds entered the marine sanctuaries. Among the telemetry locations within sanctuary waters, two-thirds (24 of 36) straddled the shelf break and slope (201-2000-m depth), a pattern underscored by a concurrent vessel-based survey in which 144 Black-footed Albatrosses were sighted. This study illustrates the value of coordinated satellite telemetry and vessel-based surveys to assess the distributions of protected species within existing marine protected areas. More specifically, our results underscore the importance of three central California marine sanctuaries to Hawaiian albatrosses breeding in subtropical waters, approximately 4500 km away. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bathymetry; Black-footed albatross; Marine protected areas; National marine sanctuaries; Phoebastria nigripes; Satellite telemetry","California; California Current; North America; Pacific Ocean; United States; Aves; Cetacea; Ciconiiformes; Phoebastria nigripes; Testudines; dispersion; protected area; satellite altimetry; seabird","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33645030024"

This is important in the process of the evaluation of protected areas. The criterion used to delimit functional-spatial units is the degree of naturalness of the landscape. The division of areas makes it possible to order information and justify the 'continuity' of ecological and economic functions in the given area. In the applicational part of the study, selected examples are used to illustrate the idea of function zonation, which is treated as a basis for solving man-environment conflicts.

However, the utility of single-species management has been questioned in recent scientific literature, making it appropriate to review the spectacled bear's efficacy as a conservation tool. The spectacled bear does not enjoy unqualified public support in CBR and surroundings, suggesting that it may not be appropriate as a flagship species. It may be more effective as a keystone species; its diet and migratory habits suggest that it may have a significant impact on plant community structure through fruit dispersal. However, more research is needed in this arena before drawing any conclusions. The spectacled bear is perhaps most appropriate as an umbrella species because of its large home range, which encompasses at least two ecosystem types: páramo and montane forest. Traditionally, the concept of the umbrella species has stressed minimum area requirements, but the spectacled bear may be a more effective umbrella species if its dispersal requirements and seasonal migration patterns are also addressed. EcoCiencia, an Ecuadorian research organization, recently constructed a habitat model for spectacled bear. They are uniquely positioned to address issues of habitat connectivity both within and between the protected areas of CBR. In doing so, they could influence future zoning decisions in and around CBR, an area that is experiencing rapid population growth. This could improve conservation efforts for spectacled bear and other species. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Species richness and endemism richness hotspots, biogeographic zoning and complementarity analysis were tested for their efficiency at representing the total suite of species. The hotspot approaches demonstrated low efficiency, as the sections of coastline selected were grouped together in isolated geographic locations and relatively few of the total suite of neritic fish species were represented. Biogeographic zoning divided the coast of Western Australia into six regions, and as such, priority areas were selected around the entire coastline, which resulted in fairly high levels of efficiency. However, the complementarity analysis proved to be the most efficient method, as >95% of all neritic fish species could be represented in six, appropriately located, 100 km long sections of coastline. Complementarity analysis indicated a total of 26 priority areas for neritic fish conservation, which were spread around the entire coast of Western Australia. However, as current marine conservation measures in Western Australia are focused on the west and northwest coasts, this study highlighted the need for marine conservation efforts to be extended to cover the north and south coasts.","Biogeography; Endemism; Iterative selection; Marine protected areas; Species richness","Australasia; Australia; Eastern Hemisphere; Western Australia; World; Pisces; biogeography; conservation; endemism; ichthyofauna; protected area; species richness","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-20444467683"

What appears to form a decent coverage, however, consists of protected enclaves - protected areas, species, or resources - without proper consideration for the interrelationships they have within ecosystems. This is illustrated by the scope of regional Pacific salmon fishing agreements, which pursue conservation but exclude the protection of freshwater spawning habitats. Nature reserves and other protective land zoning, in turn, provide for riverine biodiversity only to the extent that they protect ecosystem integrity within reserve boundaries. The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity is currently the only global treaty addressing the protection and restoration of structurally and functionally diverse ecosystems at the landscape level.

The principle tool of management is zoning for multiple use. We examined surveillance and illegal fishing around two inshore islands (Magnetic and Orpheus) of the GBR Marine Park in 2000/2001. Both islands are near Townsville, the largest city adjacent to the GBR. Surveillance effort was low, with vessels present on only 16% of days of the year. Measurable but low levels of illegal recreational fishing occurred within no-take zones. Levels decreased with increasing surveillance effort. Thus zoning was not completely successful in protecting fish targeted by fisheries, even within the most highly enforced sections of the Park. The expansion of no-take zones in 2004 from 4.6% to 33.4% of the area of the 358,000 km2 Park represents a considerable challenge for future surveillance and enforcement. © Taylor and Francis Inc.","Enforcement; Great Barrier Reef; No-take marine protected areas; Poaching; Surveillance","Australasia; Australia; Great Barrier Reef Marine Park; Queensland; Coastal zones; Fish ponds; Fisheries; Parks; Zoning; barrier reef; marine park; poaching; resource management; sport fishing; surveillance and enforcement; Enforcement; Fishing; Great Barrier Reef (GBR); Inshore islands; Reefs","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-5044220776"

This volume presents a variety of perspectives on the meaning, forms, methods, international cooperation, and experiences in integrated coastal management in 14 countries through 13 papers authored by experts in Latin American experiences. At present, the new international forums and the economic and environmental globalization induce different strategies for evaluating the real problems and advance towards planning the integrated coastal management, both from a national or regional perspective. At the opening of the new millenium Latin America has new scenarios under NAFTA, MERCOSUR, APEC, CARICOM, moreover a number of bi- or trilateral international agreements. The purpose of this Special Issue is to expose various definitions and points of view on integrated coastal management, providing an up-to-date assessment of key issues and country experiences, but not necessarily to resolving or reconciling divergent perspectives. Latin America is a 'new world mosaic'. A mosaic of authors' training and experiences; of roots and cultural/heritage resources; of social development; of ecosystems and ecological approaches; of biogeographical regions and biodiversity; of climatic zones; of pristine areas as well as highly degraded zones. This Special Issue has four key word/concepts in its title: (a) coastal zone; (b) integrated coastal zone management; (c) sustainable development, and (d) Latin America. In this introductory paper I offer what are the terms of reference meaning of each of this concern, as a framework for the invited papers/countries included in this volume. In the last section each contribution is summarized and a classification inside 'coastal management techniques' is presented, concluding that the papers incise on: Coastal management plans, Land-use zoning and setbacks, Marine protected areas, Management and restoration of coastal habitats, Coastal pollution control, Shoreline stabilization, Close access regimes, Capacity building, Inter-agency coordination, Conflict resolutions, Environmental assessment, and International cooperation. The variations in scope and the amount of progress made by different Latin American countries show the difficulty of creating a single integrating management approach. Nevertheless, at the opening of the new millenium Latin America will arrive at a competitive maturity stage concerning ICZM.","","Central America; South America; coastal zone management; institutional framework; sustainable development","Editorial","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033004479"

We conducted the first marine gap analysis for California by comparing distributions of major ecosystems and habitats with existing marine protected areas. Less than 0.3% of state and federal waters (to the bottom of the continental slope) are within no-take or limited-take marine protected areas (MPAs). With few exceptions, less than 5% of marine habitats are within no-take or limited-take MPAs that afford a high level of ecosystem protection.

Improved documentation of these fisheries is needed to gauge global trends, identify the threats to their sustainability, and assess management options. Combining semi-structured interviews and participant observation, this study provides baseline information about the nature and scale of small-scale fisheries in the Ko Chang archipelago, Thailand, as a first step towards instituting a monitoring and management strategy for the area. Although the area has been designated as a ""no-take"" Marine National Park, small-scale fisheries have continued virtually unabated within the park's boundaries. Small-scale fishers living in the park are involved primarily in the shrimp trammel net, squid trap, crab trap, fish gill net, hook-and-line, and reef fish trap fisheries. Small-scale fishing boats operating out of villages on Ko Chang and Ko Maisi Yai worked for an estimated 38,000 days/year and took 330,000 kg/year of target fish and invertebrates, based on extrapolations from interviews. Observed catches of target species were, however, an average of 42-64% lower than fishers' reported catches for the fisheries in which both data collection methods could be used. Such a finding suggests that future monitoring should rely on observational techniques to assess the catches and efforts of small-scale participants. Given the area's status as a national park, regular monitoring of the small-scale fisheries should be undertaken and multiple-use zoning be considered. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The concept of sustainability was introduced in the 1980s with a world conservation strategy arguing that natural biological populations produce a surplus which can be harvested in a sustainable manner. This policy moved considerably in the 1990s with the recognition that most uses are detrimental and a sustainable harvest is difficult to calculate or achieve. Apart from problems in the determination of environmental and biological factors governing sustainability, it was also recognized that social and economic forces play a major role. Thus, the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1992 was founded upon conservation, sustainable use and an equitable sharing of the benefits from resources. Integrated Marine and Coastal Area Management (LMCAM) also known as Integrated Costal Zone Management has been suggested to be the most suitable strategy to manage human impacts on marine and coastal biodiversity and to promote conservation and sustainable use of biological resources.

At the biological and ecological level, herbicides have been found to have more impacts on flora and fauna compared to mechanical treatments, but the differences are of short duration. The effects of noise generated by manual or mechanical brushing on wildlife have not been investigated, however. Local application of herbicide at the base of the tree should further lower these impacts. At the social level, the general public has a negative perception of chemical treatments, while mechanical treatments are well-perceived. However, in terms of worker safety, chemical treatments are less risky than manual brushing (brushsaw or chainsaw). At the economic level, herbicides globally cost less and are more effective at increasing fibre production than mechanical operations. We conclude that it is difficult to assess globally what is the most sustainable option to control competing vegetation. However, the careful use of herbicide may be the most sustainable option if the added productivity thus obtained is used to increase protected areas and ecosystem-based management, as is intended with the TRIAD concept.","Chemical release; Ecological impacts; Economical impacts; Forest vegetation management; Functional zoning; Intensive management; Mechanical release; Plantations; Social impacts; Sustainable forestry","Ecology; Forestry; Plants; Sustainable Forest Management; Ecology; Sustainable development; Vegetation; Chemical release; Ecological impacts; Economical impacts; Forest vegetation management; Functional zoning; Intensive management; Mechanical release; Social impacts; chemical control; comparative study; ecological impact; forest management; herbicide; mechanical control; plantation forestry; safety; social impact; sustainable forestry; Forestry","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-35548973350"

Different species differ in their sensitivity to human disturbance and, although birds may habituate to visitors, inappropriate intrusions at poorly managed sites may result in adverse effects on breeding individuals. The rapid growth of wildlife-based tourism and recreation in coastal Patagonia, Argentina, presents opportunities for significant economic benefits but also raises concerns about the potential effects on seabird colonies. Sixteen seabird species breed along the Patagonian coast, with Magellanic Penguin Spheniscus magellanicus being one of the main tourist attractions. At least 27 sites where seabirds breed are currently visited by people either through organized tourism or for recreational purposes, 19 of which are included in coastal protected areas. The number of visitors per year varies from 50 to more than 100,000, depending on the site. Negative effects on seabird reproduction in Patagonia are through direct destruction of nests or their contents and desertion of offspring, particularly at locations where seabirds nest in association with or near to colonies of avian predators. Tourism and recreation activities are growing in extent and intensity at most coastal sectors in Patagonia. Current trends in coastal recreation activities may result in negative effects on breeding seabirds unless management guidelines are developed and enforced. Information shows that tourism in coastal Patagonia is compatible with seabird conservation if appropriately managed. Given the rapid increase in the interest in visiting seabird colonies in Patagonia, several management tools such as sanctuaries, the limitation of visitor numbers and both temporal and spatial zoning, need to be implemented in the short term.","","Argentina; Aves; Spheniscidae; Spheniscus magellanicus; conservation management; ecological impact; recreational activity; seabird; tourism","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035703257"

The marine resources of this Reserve, Bali Barat, are described, together with the various ways in which they are at present being exploited. The plan developed for the Reserve aims to prohibit destructive uses, while allowing those which are not as yet considered damaging to the area. The needs for strict protection of certain sites for tourism and for subsistence uses have been reconciled through a system of zones. The experience gained from Bali Barat should enable effective marine reserve conservation to be extended to other parts of the country, and the Reserve could also contribute directly to education of the public, and to research and management expertise. © 1983.","","Bali; land use zoning; nature reserves","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0020695139"

Although the management of MPAs usually focuses on one dominant use or intention, the existence of competing users often demonstrate the need for multiple-use management. When appropriate to utilize, this approach may promote the maximum employment of possible uses while providing for the prevention of conflicts over space, time, and resources. For example, despite the predominant emphasis in most MPAs, management may also concentrate upon cultural,historic, and socio-economic concerns of the nations and people directly affected by the area's designation. With proper controls and planning some protected areas may accommodate several non-interfering uses without compromising the protection of natural ecosystems or habitats. This can lead, thus, to long-term sustainable resource management. A number of ocean management techniques exist to address the potential dilemma of multiple uses within marine protected areas. Chief among these are the establishment of zones of activity ( or non-activity). Although ocean processes do not respect human jurisdictional boundaries, and biological communities and resources are not uniformly distributes within the large-scale marine system, the use of zone strives to create a management system that meets multiple objectives while maintaining the ecological integrity of an area. Several successful and non-successful multiple-use MPA management plans that utilize zoning are currently in place and can be compared.","","Coastal zones; Ecology; Land use; Oceanography; Regional planning; Marine protected areas; Multiple use; Ocean management techniques; Job analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027188418"

By integrating organism dispersal rates, ecosystem interactions and fishing effort dynamics, ECOSPACE, a spatially explicit ecosystem-based modeling tool, allowed us to compare the ecological consequences of alternative MPA zoning policies within the proposed Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area, located off the west coast of British Columbia, Canada. The desired effects of MPAs include higher fishery yields, the conservation of biodiversity, and/or the preservation of intact ecosystems. However, ECOSPACE predicts that when MPAs are small, species interactions and movements may make these objectives difficult to achieve. ECOSPACE suggests that the effects of MPAs are reduced at their boundaries where fishing effort is predicted to concentrate. Furthermore, top predators may become more abundant within MPAs, which could lead to a depression of their prey species and a subsequent increase of species at even lower trophic levels. Trophic cascade patterns and density gradients across boundaries are nontrivial departures from our simple expectations of how MPAs protect areas and will force us to reconsider what constitutes effective conservation. Our ECOSPACE model indicates that the establishment of multi-use buffer zones may help alleviate these realistic but worrisome ecological predictions. When coupled with an overall reduction in harvest pressure, ECOSPACE suggests that a MPA with a large core 'no-take' zone and large buffer will result in the greatest increase in organism biomass. The use of marine zoning may be an effective management tactic to reduce social conflict and conserve marine ecosystems.","Adaptive management; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem modeling; Marine reserve design; Marine zoning; Trophic cascade","Canada; conservation management; ecosystem management; ecosystem modeling; marine park; protected area; trophic cascade; zoning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036174178"
