Only abundance and biomass of adult of both commercial and demersal species were positively affected by protection. Gradients across reserve boundaries (as a clue to the occurrence of spillover) were observed for fish abundance but not for biomass, indicating a protected fish assemblage with a predominance of small-sized individuals. Also, post-larvae of commercial species were negatively related to protected zones. Active selection of settlement preferred habitats, larval accumulation favoured by the geomorphological configuration of the coast or mixed effects has been proposed as possible explanations. Juveniles showed high spatial variability resulting in a lack of response to fishing protection measures. We highlight the need of including early life stages and overall suitable habitats for them when designing MPA networks due to the crucial importance of these stages to successful fulfillment of MPA objectives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Effect of protection; Enforcement; Habitat selection; Larvae retention; MPA network; Spillover","Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Fishes; Life Cycle Stages; Mediterranean Sea; Spain; Conservation; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Effect of protection; Enforcement; Habitat selection; Larvae retention; Spillover; environmental management; environmental protection; fish; habitat selection; larval development; life history; marine environment; marine park; protected area; spillover effect; adult; article; biomass; commercial species; fishing; habitat selection; human; juvenile; life history; nonhuman; postlarva; seashore; Spain; animal; ecosystem; environmental protection; fish; fishery; life cycle stage; physiology; Fish","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048883523"

This study aimed to assess the effect of human disturbance on the population structure of Pterocarpus erinaceus in different land use types (Highly protected area, Moderately protected area and Non-protected area) in Sudanian savannahs of Togo. Data were collected in forty randomly set plots (50 m × 30 m) within each land use type. Population structure parameters and leaf and leaflet morphological traits were evaluated and compared among the land use types by performing different statistical analyses. Results showed an adverse effect of human disturbance on adult and juveniles densities as well as the total height (significant difference between highly protected and non-protected areas; p < 0.001). Diameter class structures revealed in the three land use types an inverted J-shape indicating the predominance of young individuals. Significantly greater (p < 0.001) values of leaflet length were observed in the non-protected area compared to highly protected one. The human-mediated area impacted the diameter-height relation and the one among assessed leaf and leaflet traits. These findings are tools to be incorporated in new policy development for the future management of this tree species population. Résumé Les systèmes modifiés par les hommes sont des systèmes nouveaux qu'il faut mieux comprendre afin d'atteindre les objectifs de conservation de la biodiversité. Cette étude visait à évaluer l'effet de perturbations humaines sur la structure de populations de Pterocarpus erinaceus dans différents types d'utilisation des (zone très protégée, moyennement protégée et non protégée) dans des savanes soudaniennes du Togo. Des données furent récoltées dans des 40 parcelles de 50 m x 30 m installées de façon aléatoire dans chaque type d'utilisation des terres Les paramètres de la structure des populations et les caractéristiques morphologiques des feuilles et folioles ont été évalués et comparés selon les types d'utilisation des terres en faisant différentes analyses statistiques.Les résultats ont montré un effet négatif des perturbations humaines sur la densité des jeunes et des adultes ainsi que sur la hauteur totale (différence significative entre parcelle très protégée et non protégée : P<0,001). La structure des classes de diamètre a révélé dans les trois types d'utilisation des terres une forme en J renversé qui indique la prédominance de jeunes individus. Des valeurs significativement plus grandes (P<0,001) de la longueur des folioles ont été observées dans la zone non protégée que dans la zone très protégée. La zone impactée par les hommes influence la relation diamètre-hauteur et celle entre les caractéristiques évaluées des feuilles petites et grandes.

To evaluate this assertion, we sampled trees in areas with four different levels of protection: a National Park, where the protection level is very high, a Game Controlled Area which allows tourist hunting of big game animals, a Forest Reserve which allows selective harvest of trees, and an Open Area where human populations have unrestricted access to forest resources. All four land management areas had healthy size-class distributions with greater numbers of juvenile trees (2-10 cm DBH) than adults. Surprisingly, mean stem density of trees was highest (947 stems ha-1) in the Game Controlled Area but was lowest (635 stems ha-1) in the National Park. The former had the highest basal area value (24 m2 ha-1) while the human-inhabited Open Area had the lowest (11 m2 ha-1). Species richness in the Forest Reserve and Game Controlled Area was significantly higher than in the other areas. The total number of plots with unique species not found anywhere else was lowest in the National. Our measures of forest structure and composition therefore show that fully protected National Parks do not necessarily conserve the greatest diversity of tree species or unique species, indicating that a suite of different types of protection strategies may be the key to conservation of trees in these African dry tropical forests. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the persistence of highly diverse carnivore guilds, management idiosyncrasies are often orientated towards charismatic large predators and assemblage-level patterns remain largely unexplored. We conducted an extensive camera-trap survey in a natural quasi-experimental setting in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We sampled across a protection gradient characterized by a provincial protected area (highest and formal protection status), a private ecotourism reserve, game ranches and traditional communal areas (lowest protected status). We evaluated assemblage-level and species-specific responses of free-ranging carnivores to the varying management contexts and associated environmental gradients. Despite similar assemblage composition between management contexts, site-scale carnivore richness and occupancy rates were greater in the formal protected area than adjacent private reserve and game ranches. Carnivore occupancy was more similar between these private wildlife areas, although putative problem species were more common in the private reserve, and contrasted with depauperate assemblages in least protected communal lands. Variation in carnivore occupancy probabilities was largely driven by land use contexts, that is, the level and nature of protection, relative to underlying fine-scale landscape attributes (e.g. distance to conservation fences) or apex predator populations. Synthesis and applications. Our findings provide convincing empirical support for the added value of multi-tenure conservation estates augmenting and connecting South Africa's protected areas. However, our emphasis on free-ranging carnivores exemplifies the importance of maintaining areas under long-term formal protection and the risks with viewing lucrative wildlife business as a conservation panacea. We suggest that unmanaged carnivore species be the formal components of carnivore reintroduction and recovery programmes to better gauge the complementary conservation role of South Africa's private land. © 2020 British Ecological Society","camera-trap; community occupancy model; conservation planning; hierarchical Bayesian models; multi-species modelling; natural resource management; predator; protected areas","KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa; carnivore; conservation status; ecotourism; environmental gradient; land use; landscape change; predator; protected area; reintroduction; wild population","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089785645"

We measured how density and survival rates of a previously unstudied leopard population varied across a gradient of protection and evaluated which anthropogenic activities accounted for observed patterns. Insights into this generalist's response to human encroachment are likely to identify limiting factors for other sympatric carnivore species. Motion-sensitive cameras were deployed systematically in adjacent, similarly sized, and ecologically similar study areas inside and outside Zambia's South Luangwa National Park (SLNP) from 2012 to 2014. The sites differed primarily in the degree of human impacts: SLNP is strictly protected, but the adjacent area was subject to human encroachment and bushmeat poaching throughout the study, and trophy hunting of leopards prior to 2012. We used photographic capture histories with robust design capture-recapture models to estimate population size and sex-specific survival rates for the two areas. Leopard density within SLNP was 67% greater than in the adjacent area, but annual survival rates and sex ratios did not detectably differ between the sites. Prior research indicated that wire-snare occurrence was 5.2 times greater in the areas adjacent to the park. These results suggest that the low density of leopards on the periphery of SLNP is better explained by prey depletion, rather than by direct anthropogenic mortality. Long-term spatial data from concurrent lion studies suggested that interspecific competition did not produce the observed patterns. Large carnivore populations are often limited by human activities, but science-based management policies depend on methods to rigorously and quantitatively assess threats to populations of concern. Using noninvasive robust design capture-recapture methods, we systematically assessed leopard density and survival across a protection gradient and identified bushmeat poaching as the likely limiting factor. This approach is of broad value to evaluate the impacts of anthropogenic activities on carnivore populations that are distributed across gradients of protection. © 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Anthropogenic effects; Bushmeat; Harvest; Leopard; Panthera pardus; Prey depletion; Robust design","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965082421"

By building on a graph-theoretical modeling framework, we here develop a connectivity model of how varying levels of area protection and unprotected areas predetermined for destruction affect species differently depending on (1) their tradeoff in colonization versus habitat utilization ability and (2) their maximum dispersal ability. We apply our model to 20,000 patches of old pine forest in northern Sweden, which host many threatened species but are scattered in a landscape dominated by intensive forestry. Unprotected mature forests stands predestined for logging are treated as adequate but temporarily available habitat for colonization specialists, whereas the same stands are assumed to, at best, serve only as intermediate stepping-stones for habitat specialists as they disperse between long-standing forests in protected areas. Our results show that the effect of habitat fragmentation on metapopulation persistence differs greatly not only depending on the dispersal distance of a particular species, but also on how well it utilizes habitat patches of different longevity. Such traits are discussed with respect to the spatiotemporal planning of habitat protection. Also, we suggest that the negative impacts of logging on biodiversity may be reduced if forestry practice is adjusted to better account for the ecological values of maturing production stands, through spatially explicit modeling of connectivity and of complementarity in the protection gradient. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Dispersal; Disturbance; Fragmentation; Graph theory; Network; Planning; Protected area","Sweden; biodiversity; colonization; complementarity; coniferous forest; connectivity; conservation planning; dispersal; habitat conservation; habitat fragmentation; logging (timber); metapopulation; protected area; specialist; trade-off","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84875063514"

These forests harbor relatively high species diversity, yet are threatened by fire suppression, land development, timber-focused management, extended droughts, and chronic herbivory. ""Pando"" is a high-profile quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) forest in Utah, USA which is putatively the 'largest living organism on earth.' Pando comprises an estimated 47,000 genetically identical stems, but is threatened by human impacts. Our interest in the present study is whether changes to the giant organism were affecting understorey vegetation and whether discrete zones are displaying divergent community compositions. For instance, recent research has demonstrated strong herbivory impacts that are affecting portions of Pando differentially. This study consists of 20 randomly distributed vegetation survey plots within three de facto management regimes (hereafter, management group or type) along an herbivory protection gradient: No Fence, 2013 Fence (total protection), and 2014 Fence (imperfect protection). The plant survey was supplemented by previously-established forest and herbivore measurements to test for community assemblage explanatory agents. Sixty-eight species were found across the entire study. Analyses indicated strong links between management group orientation, species assemblages, and tree density/canopy openings. We found distinct evidence that within management group species composition was more similar than across groups for two of the three pairings. However, the other pairing, the most successfully protected area and the completely unprotected area, was not statistically distinct; likely a result a deteriorating overstorey in these two areas, whereas the third management type (2014 Fence) exhibited higher canopy cover. Indicator species analysis found that a small group of plant species had statistical allegiances to specific management groups, suggesting resource preference selection within Pando. Ordination analysis searching for causal factors reached two broad conclusions: (1) aspen regeneration, and therefore long-term resilience, is being negatively affected by chronic animal browsing and (2) current understorey species diversity is highest where forest canopy gaps are abundant. Future research at the massive Pando clone will continue informing linkages between understorey communities and overstorey-driven ecological pathways. © 2019 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Community ecology; Herbivory; Indicator species; Ordination; Populus tremuloides; Regeneration; Trembling aspen; Understorey vegetation; Ungulates","Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Plants; Populus Tremuloides; Surveys; United States; Utah; Animalia; Populus tremuloides; Ungulata; Biodiversity; Cloning; Conservation; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Fences; Surveys; Vegetation; Community ecology; Herbivory; Indicator species; Ordination; Populus tremuloides; Regeneration; Trembling aspen; Understorey vegetation; Ungulates; biodiversity; conservation management; forest management; herbivory; ordination; preference behavior; sustainability; sustainable development; Reforestation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079743192"
