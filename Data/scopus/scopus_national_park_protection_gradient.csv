To evaluate this assertion, we sampled trees in areas with four different levels of protection: a National Park, where the protection level is very high, a Game Controlled Area which allows tourist hunting of big game animals, a Forest Reserve which allows selective harvest of trees, and an Open Area where human populations have unrestricted access to forest resources. All four land management areas had healthy size-class distributions with greater numbers of juvenile trees (2-10 cm DBH) than adults. Surprisingly, mean stem density of trees was highest (947 stems ha-1) in the Game Controlled Area but was lowest (635 stems ha-1) in the National Park. The former had the highest basal area value (24 m2 ha-1) while the human-inhabited Open Area had the lowest (11 m2 ha-1). Species richness in the Forest Reserve and Game Controlled Area was significantly higher than in the other areas. The total number of plots with unique species not found anywhere else was lowest in the National. Our measures of forest structure and composition therefore show that fully protected National Parks do not necessarily conserve the greatest diversity of tree species or unique species, indicating that a suite of different types of protection strategies may be the key to conservation of trees in these African dry tropical forests. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Its status in the region is described only from interviews that confirmed its presence until 2003. To update information on the distribution and population density of this species we undertook three camera-trap surveys, combined with searches for sign, at sites across latitudinal and protection gradients, and 156 interviews with local inhabitants across three larger areas. The camera-trap sites were located in areas with the highest density of records in the Argentine Chaco: Copo National Park (1,204 trap days, 24 stations, 344 km of transects), Aborigen Reserve (1,993 trap days, 30 stations, 251 km of transects) and El Cantor (2,129 trap days, 35 stations, 297 km of transects). We did not obtain any photographs of jaguars. We recorded very few jaguar tracks, and only in the Aborigen Reserve (n = 3) and El Cantor (n = 1). The map of distribution points confirmed through interviews suggests that the jaguar range has not changed significantly in the past 10 years; however, the camera-trap and sign surveys suggest that densities are extremely low. Before our study the Chaco population was thought to be the largest in Argentina. This perception was incorrect: the Chaco jaguar population is the most threatened in the country. Systematic, intensive studies are essential to provide the necessary information for decision-making for the management and conservation of threatened species.

We measured how density and survival rates of a previously unstudied leopard population varied across a gradient of protection and evaluated which anthropogenic activities accounted for observed patterns. Insights into this generalist's response to human encroachment are likely to identify limiting factors for other sympatric carnivore species. Motion-sensitive cameras were deployed systematically in adjacent, similarly sized, and ecologically similar study areas inside and outside Zambia's South Luangwa National Park (SLNP) from 2012 to 2014. The sites differed primarily in the degree of human impacts: SLNP is strictly protected, but the adjacent area was subject to human encroachment and bushmeat poaching throughout the study, and trophy hunting of leopards prior to 2012. We used photographic capture histories with robust design capture-recapture models to estimate population size and sex-specific survival rates for the two areas. Leopard density within SLNP was 67% greater than in the adjacent area, but annual survival rates and sex ratios did not detectably differ between the sites. Prior research indicated that wire-snare occurrence was 5.2 times greater in the areas adjacent to the park. These results suggest that the low density of leopards on the periphery of SLNP is better explained by prey depletion, rather than by direct anthropogenic mortality. Long-term spatial data from concurrent lion studies suggested that interspecific competition did not produce the observed patterns. Large carnivore populations are often limited by human activities, but science-based management policies depend on methods to rigorously and quantitatively assess threats to populations of concern. Using noninvasive robust design capture-recapture methods, we systematically assessed leopard density and survival across a protection gradient and identified bushmeat poaching as the likely limiting factor. This approach is of broad value to evaluate the impacts of anthropogenic activities on carnivore populations that are distributed across gradients of protection. © 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Anthropogenic effects; Bushmeat; Harvest; Leopard; Panthera pardus; Prey depletion; Robust design","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965082421"

Level three, Corine Land Cover (CLC) data between 2005 and 2011 were compared. Official wildfire digital data were obtained from the European Commission for the 2005–2011 period. Results show increasing numbers of LULC changes along the protection gradient: NPs < PPZs < SIZs. NPs were, in general, highly stable regarding LULC changes and less affected by wildfires, which suggests high environmental effectiveness of legal and managerial protection afforded to the Spanish NP Network. Three study areas (SAs) were very stable in the analysed period in all their zones: Aigüestortes, Ordesa y Monte Perdido and Caldera de Taburiente. In turn, Teide and Doñana were the SAs where LULC changes were more abundant. Unsustainable LULC changes concentrate in NPs' peripheral areas, chiefly in their SIZs, with wildfires being the most widespread pressure in the analysed period. Teide's SA outstands due to its environmentally unsustainable recent LULC changes, with urbanisation and wildfires affecting natural and semi-natural areas. Sustainable territorial planning and management practices should prioritise this SA. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Forest fire; Land use-land cover transition; Reserve; Spain; Zoning","Aragon; Caldera de Taburiente National Park; Canary Islands; Huesca [Aragon]; La Palma; Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park; Santa Cruz de Tenerife [(PRV) Canary Islands]; Spain; Teide National Park; Tenerife; environmental assessment; forest fire; land cover; land use change; national park; sustainability; territorial management; zoning policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030158084"
