A total of 2229 individuals were sampled and 43 Chironomidae taxa were recorded with Orthocladiinae (29) being the best represented subfamily, followed by Diamesinae (5), Tanypodinae (3), Podonominae (3) and Chironominae (3). Stictocladius spF, Cricotopus (Paratrichocladius) sp6, Cricotopus sp2, Cricotopus sp3 and Parapsectrocladius sp2 were the most abundant taxa. Sites near the source of the river system were dominated by Podonomus sp., Limnophyes sp., Parapsectrocladius sp. and Stictocladius spF, whereas sites close to the river mouth were dominated by Diamesinae sp5 and Cricotopus sp. Rank/abundance plots show that all the analysed sites displayed dominance of some species. Stictocladius spF, Cricotopus sp2, Cricotopus sp3, Cricotopus (Paratrichocladius) sp6, Parapsectrocladius sp. and Limnophyes sp. resulted as dominant species, or being part of a group of dominant species, at least in one sample. Eleven taxa were associated with habitats related with riffle areas and stable substrates with filamentous algae. Species–environment relationships were examined using ordination analysis. Elevation was the most significant environmental variable that explained 22% of the total variability of the chironomid assemblages, showing stronger relationships among sites within an altitudinal gradient than among habitat type. Abundance of chironomids increased from headwaters to the outflow in Nahuel Huapi Lake responding to an altitude gradient as well as some environmental factors such as coarse matter and nutrient concentrations. © 2016, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.","altitudinal zonation; Chironomidae; habitat preference; South America","Animals; Argentina; Biodiversity; Chironomidae; Ecosystem; Larva; Population Dynamics; Rivers; animal; Argentina; biodiversity; Chironomidae; ecosystem; larva; population dynamics; river","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010015226"

Regarding the spatial nature conservation within Central Europe, the environmental pillar has been threatened. Long lasting human pressure on landscape has created cultural landscape with only small fragments of close-to-nature habitats. Šumava National Park plays exceptional role, it is one of the largest protected and forested areas in the region. However, Šumava National Park administration has gone through various periods with different outcomes for its protection. Therefore, we applied prioritization concept to evaluate management of National Park and its zonation. We based it on objective data and statistical approaches. Our results were compared with data of anthropogenic structures and activities as built-up, recreational and developable areas. Somewhere, as we show in the article, problems between conservation priorities and human use of the area arises. By these analyses we stress the problem of sustainability in the most valuable protected natural areas of Central Europe, where also societal and economic interests are eminent. © 2022 Public Recreation and Landscape Protection - With Environment Hand in Hand?

In Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, where elephant populations have been increasing, management have adopted a zonation approach, with zones identified for specific and measurable management interventions to control elephant populations, or to reduce conflict with humans. Localised culling is one proposed management intervention. The zones, partly derived from static annual elephant distribution surveys, are intended to encompass only localised effects on elephant within that zone, assuming no effect into adjacent undisturbed zones, or into contiguous neighbouring landholdings outside KNP. We deployed 17 GPS/GSM collars on free-roaming elephant herds within KNP to assess their seasonal home-range use and size and daily movement paths. These temporally robust movement metrics were analyzed against the Park's elephant management zones, partly derived from sporadic telemetry fixes and static distribution counts. Multiple daily and seasonal spatial shifts by elephant across neighbouring zones, including into adjacent reserves, rendered the principle of exclusive zoning at this management scale incorrect. The KNP management zones and proposed management actions are not biologically relevant to elephant, or appropriate for managing the ecological or human-wildlife impact of elephant, resulting in spatial and temporal scale mismatches. We predict that the intended management actions, specifically culling, and its resultant intended consequences (immigration, reduced vegetation impact and reduced growth due to disturbance) is not localised to the target zone, and, because it is season specific, is at risk of targeting transient non-resident elephant whilst missing resident elephant that have crossed into other zones. This scale mismatch may have a ripple effect outside the target zone, causing serious ecological risks, especially given the documented long-term negative effects of management disturbance on elephant. We further quantify this scale mismatch into four categories based on percentages of the following factors: the proportion of sampled population affected, the seasonal zone occupancy (the proportion of locations per zone per season) and number of zone crossings, and the governance of management units (consistency of management interventions imposed across zones). This generates a prediction of the risk of this exclusive zoning and its consequences. We suggest a new approach, whereby, known elephant intensity of use at local scales is adaptively managed for specific management objectives. However, management must occur within a known and contained zone of influence defined by elephant behaviour derived from resident movement studies, as opposed to broad scale zonation at the population or park level. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Elephant; Kruger National Park; Management effects; Ranging behaviour; Scale mismatch","Kruger National Park; South Africa; ecosystem structure; ecotourism; elephant; governance approach; GPS; growth response; keystone species; management practice; policy making; population structure; species conservation; temporal analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84882932368"

The aim of the study was to analyse the diversity and vertical zonation of epiphytic mosses and liverworts on selected tree types (Quercus petraea, Betula pendula and Pinus sylvestris) within windthrow areas in the Kampinoski National Park (Central Poland). The investigations were performed in five parts of the trees: the tree base, lower trunk, upper trunk, lower crown, and upper crown. Deciduous trees have more species than pine trees (13 on Quercus and Betula, 8 on Pinus). The type of phorophyte was crucial for the differences in the species composition from the tree base to the upper crown that was observed. The highest richness of bryophytes was recorded on the tree bases, while the lowest was recorded in the upper parts of the crowns. The variability of the habitat conditions in the vertical gradient on the trunk that affected the patterns of the occurrence of species with different ecological preferences was determined using the Ellenberg indicator values.

Crypsis, a usual form of camouflage, involves, among many other strategies, disruptive coloration that uses marks that disguise the contours of creatures to hide it. Fish that live on coral reefs have developed several cryptic strategies to avoid the risk of detection. The blue-spotted cornetfish, Fistularia commersonii, presents a pattern of dark bands that give the perception of disruptive coloration; however, this strategy has not been characterized for this fish. This study was conducted on the eastern coral reefs of Gorgona Island National Natural Park (Colombia). To confirm whether F. commersonii presents a disruptive pattern, photographs, and videos in situ of the individuals were taken, in addition to recording aspects of their behavior during changes in coloration. After strict selection, different images were processed and evaluated using three different visual systems (potential predator, potential prey, and human) to calculate the GabRat metric, that is detect consistent to inconsistent edges of a pattern. The images analysed and the observations indicate that this species displays a disruptive pattern that is used more frequently in the reef flat and during alert states, either in the presence of a possible predator or during the search for food. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","alertness; detectability; disruptive pattern; GabRat; reef zonation; Syngnathiformes","Colombia; Gorgona Island; Gorgona National Park; Valle del Cauca; color morph; coral reef; crypsis; fish; marine ecosystem","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143157840"

We compared the extent of forested, nonforested, and fragmented areas between lowland (<1000 masl) and montane zones of the Blue Mountains inside the Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park established in Jamaica in 1993. We found that in 2008, inside the montane zone, only 4 percent of forest was cleared, and forest fragmentation was minimal. In the lowland zone, however, the percentage of forest cleared was seven times as high, and the density of fragments was 11-fold higher. We established twenty-five 0.04ha lowland plots; ordination of tree species composition in these plots reflected a rainfall gradient, showing that plots on the wetter northern side of the Blue Mountains were floristically different from those on the drier southern side. The conservation value of the remaining lowland forest is high because of its high endemism (18% of species in our plots) and beta diversity. In addition, IUCN Red List data show that about 71 percent of threatened tree species in the Blue Mountains grow in the lowland region, 92 percent of which are endemic. From these findings, we identify a 'protected area hotspot zone', which lies between the PA boundary and the core high-altitude zone, and which should be instituted in IUCN categories I and II PAs. © 2010 The Author(s).

The urgency to maintain and protect their existence from land degradation and deforestation is an obligation. Moreover, deforestation is the most severe threat to biodiversity. In Kalimantan, deforestation is happening and usually leads to economic loss and poverty. Despite this habitat loss, our ability to quantify deforestation in certain areas to improve mitigation measures, meet the needs of agricultural land, and increases local communities' resilience and ensure that their customary rights. This study aims to provide models to assess the deforestation rate in Kayan Mentarang National Park and give recommendation action based on existing Land Use Zonation. To achieve this aim, firstly Landsat images was obtained and analysed to produce land use and land cover classification. However, cloud coverage in this area is more than 30% which is too difficult to classify the land cover area. This research use alternative resources from JAXA to generate deforestation map at study area. Then compile this map into map of Land Use Zonation of KMNP to provide specific location of deforestation occurrence. The result showed that deforestation rate at KMNP is low, around 3% and the Traditional Zone has the biggest amount of deforestation occurrence; 18.727 hectare. This finding would give information to the government of KMNP to accelerate empowerment program among indigenous people in term of utilizing their customary land in this zone.

Additionally, human populations living in these ecosystems are predicted to increase, exposing wildlife to additional human-induced top-down constraints and intensifying human-wildlife conflicts. We aim to investigate how surface water availability, forage availability and other landscape factors shape the spatial arrangement of large herbivore populations in a desert region, and to explore wildlife-livestock co-occurrence patterns to inform coexistence strategies that maximize conservation outputs. We fitted Bayesian zero-inflated binomial N-mixture models (Kéry and Royle 2015) to group count data collected over a 4 year period in the northern Namib desert (Iona National Park, Angola), and found that Hartmann’s mountain zebra and gemsbok preferentially forage in suboptimal low productivity flat areas, away from human activities.

We also found a reliance of Hartmann’s mountain zebra on natural water sources (βDistWater= - 1.04 ± 0.26 and βDistWater= - 0.77 ± 0.20 , for dry and wet seasons, respectively), and a weaker reliance by gemsbok (βDistWater= 0.20 ± 0.10 and βDistWater= - 0.15 ± 0.10 , respectively for dry and wet seasons). Conversely, we found springbok to forage further from available water (βDistWater= 0.43 ± 0.05 and βDistWater= 0.26 ± 0.06 , for dry and wet seasons, respectively), suggesting this species may be able to balance hydric requirements from dietary water. Our results support that human activities (inc. livestock herding) induce broad scale top-down regulation in landscape use by our target species, which are then susceptible to resource-driven bottom-up forces at a finer scale. These constraints reflect differences between the realized and expected conservation value of Iona National Park, because human-occupied areas force wildlife to suboptimal habitats. Additionally, we found significant stretches of the landscape to be co-occupied by wildlife and livestock, increasing competition for already limited resources. Our results are useful for informing conservation actions, namely through protected area zonation. Securing exclusive access to key resources by wildlife could be of utmost importance to ensure the long-term survival of these species, and to foster sustained human-wildlife coexistence. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Bottom-up regulation; Climate change; Hartmann’s mountain zebra; Human-wildlife coexistence; Namib desert; Surface water dependency","Angola; Argyll and Bute; Hebrides; Inner Hebrides; Iona; Iona National Park; Namibe; Scotland; United Kingdom; extinction risk","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131750784"

It is an estuary supplied by one of the longest rivers of Spain. The Guadalquivir estuarine channel extends from the town of Sevilla to its mouth in front of Sanlúcar de Barrameda (Cádiz), bordering Doñana National Park along its southeastern margin. Guadalquivir River has an average discharge of 185 m3/s, with a strong seasonal character. This estuarine zone is characterized by a mesotidal range, with a mean tidal amplitude of two meters. Water usually has a high concentration of suspended matter, being one of the most turbid estuaries in the world. The channel margins mainly develop muddy facies with a clearly visible parallel lamination that has been described and interpreted as a result of the alternation between wet and dry seasons and longer climatic cycles. A zonation of the estuary is suggested as a result of the tidal facies distribution. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2020.","estuarine facies; Guadalquivir; intertidal banks; suspended matter deposition","Andalucia; Atlantic Ocean; Florida [United States]; Guadalquivir Estuary; Guadalquivir River; Gulf of Cadiz; Sevilla; Spain; United States; climate cycle; estuarine environment; estuary; hydrodynamics; river discharge; seasonal variation; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085478728"

Although several studies have discussed these aspects in C3 and C4 plants, only a few have attempted to identify the major drivers of δ13C, δ18O, and δ15N in CAM plants. In this study, stable isotopic ratios of CAM plants collected along an altitudinal transect in the Chisos Mountains/USA during two growth seasons, are used to understand major factors governing isotopic variability. A strong and significant relationship between δ13C and altitude, positive for agave at <1700 m and negative for both agave and cacti at >1500 m, suggests variable carbon isotope fractionation at different altitudes, which may be unique to CAM plants. Our data suggest that temperature primarily governs δ13C of the studied plants. The significant negative correlations observed between the δ18O of agaves and the recorded air temperature (0.59‰/°C) are similar to the δ18O of precipitation vs. temperature variability in global data. The δ15N variations suggest a similar N-source for both agaves and cacti, and reflect progressive changes in the dominant N-source across desert-grassland-woodland zones.

Data points where the species were present were collected and linked to bioclimatic variables derived from monthly temperature and rainfall figures from the Africlim database and to edaphic (soil) variables. In term of environmental determinism, the most favourable areas were predicted by bioclimatic variables such as mean diurnal temperature range (Bio2), mean annual rainfall (Bio12), potential evapotranspiration (PET) and a biophysical ground variable. The most favourable protected areas for the seven tree species extended northwards from the Ketou listed forest (7°43'N) in the Guinean zone, from the Agoua listed forest (8°30'N) in the Sudano- Guinean zone and from the Pendjari National Park area (10°35'N) in the Sudanian zone.

Its populations have undergone a drastic decline in China, and have become locally extinct in some regions due to anthropogenic disturbance. However, the current literature on otters in China is inadequate, which has subsequently affected conservation of the species. We aim to assess the potential distribution and conservation priority areas of the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) in Northeast China. Biodiversity Sc Methods: In this study, we integrated species distribution models with otter survey data from 2016 to 2020 to assess Eurasian otter distribution. Then, we used the geographic information system and core-area zonation algorithm in Zonation 4.00 to identify conservation priority areas for otter protection. Using the anthropogenic pressures layer, we also evaluated anthropogenic stressors in each province. Then, we analyzed the conservation status of the otter based on the spatial distribution of national nature reserves. Furthermore, we used Inner Mongolia Forest Industry Group, Daxing’anling Forestry Group and Yichun Forest Industry Group as case studies to analyze the role of state-owned forest areas for otter conservation. Results: The results demonstrate that potential distribution and conservation priority areas cover 104,515.04 km2 and 45,448.99 km2, respectively. Large swathes of conservation priority areas remain for the otter in Daxing’anling which are connected with conservation priority areas in Xiaoxing’anling and there is no obvious geographical boundary between them. Therefore, these regions are mandatory to conserve to maintain the stability of otter populations in Northeast China. Otters in the Liaoning Province faced the greatest anthropogenic pressures, followed by the Jilin Province and Heilongjiang Province. Otters in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region faced the lowest amount of pressure. There is potential distribution for the otter in 63 nature reserves and conservation priority areas in 32 nature reserves out of the 110 reserves in the region. The study area includes 11.64% of the otter’s potential distribution and 10.88% of conservation priority areas. Three state-owned forest industry groups cover 71.18% of the potential distribution of the otter (74,390.89 km2) and 79.26% of the conservation priority areas (36,022.22 km2). Conclusions: This study indicates that state-owned forest areas may play a greater role in the protection of biodiversity following a comprehensive ban on logging in natural forests. Therefore, we propose that areas with important conservation value in state-owned forest land should be gradually included under the protections of national parks in order to achieve systematic and complete protection of biodiversity. Finally, we suggest: (1) strengthening the management of river pollutions; (2) reducing fishing intensity; (3) a long-term field monitoring network be established to study population changes in otters; (4) increasing the investment in scientific research on otters; and (5) raising awareness of otter conservation through public education. © 2022, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

It is assumed that this will assure the long-term survival of Europe's most valuable and threatened species and habitats. The new member states implemented the Natura 2000 Directives in their own legislation as a part of the EU-integration process. Here we present the practical difficulties of implementing these directives in the Czech Republic as a warning of the problems likely to be encountered in post-communist countries. Our results are mainly based on a case study of the Šumava National Park. We analyze, why Natura 2000 may not work here and look for possible solutions, which would require changes in Natura 2000 policies and their implementation in national policies. We show five examples of activities, which were performed or are still planned despite the fact that Natura 2000 evaluations have clearly shown that they have or would have had significant negative effects on Natura 2000 habitats and species. These include canoeing in pearl mussels core zones, logging of spruce stands, park zonation and management, and ski lift and tourist trails in capercaillie core zones. We deduce that the unstable political conditions together with the weak position of the state representatives in the Czech Republic result in a situation in which the last remnants of justice together with newly implemented EU directives easily disappear. We then show that the problems encountered in implementing Natura 2000 directives in the Czech Republic are likely to affect their successful implementation in most other post-communist countries. EU is supporting these countries financially, but this support should be much more conditional on full implementation of EU laws. Environmental subsidies should be conditional on fulfilment of the country's obligations to EU nature protection. Proper use of EU money should be directly controlled by central EU authorities, not left entirely to the recipients, the member states. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Biodiversity; Natura 2000; Post-communist countries; Šumava national park","Czech Republic; Sumava National Park; Aves; Picea; biodiversity; bird; endangered species; European Union; habitat management; long-term change; national planning; protected area; survival","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84927138462"

In this study, molar morphometrics were used to evaluate patterns of geographic variation in gorillas. Dental specimens of 323 adult individuals, drawn from the current distribution of gorillas in equatorial Africa were divided into 14 populations. Discriminant analyses and Mahalanobis distances were used to study population structure.Results reveal that: 1) the West and East African gorillas form distinct clusters, 2) the Cross River gorillas are well separated from the rest of the western populations, 3) gorillas from the Virunga mountains and the Bwindi Forest can be differentiated from the lowland gorillas of Utu and Mwenga-Fizi, 4) the Tshiaberimu gorillas are distinct from other eastern gorillas, and the Kahuzi-Biega gorillas are affiliated with them. These findings provide support for a species distinction between Gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei, with subspecies G. g. diehli, G. g. gorilla, G. b. graueri, G. b. beringei, and possibly, G. b. rex-pygmaeorum. Clear correspondence between dental and other patterns of taxonomic diversity demonstrates that dental data reveal underlying genetic patterns of differentiation.Dental distances increased predictably with altitude but not with geographic distances, indicating that altitudinal segregation explains gorilla patterns of population divergence better than isolation-by-distance. The phylogeographic pattern of gorilla dental metric variation supports the idea that Plio-Pleistocene climatic fluctuations and local mountain building activity in Africa affected gorilla phylogeography. I propose that West Africa comprised the historic center of gorilla distribution and experienced drift-gene flow equilibrium, whereas Nigeria and East Africa were at the periphery, where climatic instability and altitudinal variation promoted drift and genetic differentiation. This understanding of gorilla population structure has implications for gorilla conservation, and for understanding the distribution of sympatric chimpanzees and Plio-Pleistocene hominins. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Altitudinal variation; Chimpanzees; Drift; Gene flow; Gorilla; Hominins; Molar morphometrics; Phylogeography","Bwindi Impenetrable National Park; Cross River [(RVR) West Africa]; East Africa; Southern Province [Uganda]; Uganda; Virunga Mountains; West Africa; Gorilla beringei; Gorilla gorilla; Gorilla gorilla gorilla; Pan; altitudinal zonation; dentition; discriminant analysis; gene flow; genetic differentiation; genetic drift; geographical distribution; morphometry; paleobiogeography; paleoclimate; phylogeography; Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary; population structure; primate; spatial variation; species diversity; taxonomy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954217964"

We investigated the patterns of taxonomic and functional diversity of butterflies within the limits of the NATURA 2000 sites at two national parks, on the mountains Olympus and Rhodopes, in Greece. The study was conducted along an elevation gradient in 24 sampling sites on each mountain using the line transect technique. 2. Species richness and abundance followed a monotonic decline on Olympus which is much higher, steeper and has a smaller area size, whereas there was no significant pattern on Rhodopes where average richness and abundance were highest at the extended mid-elevations with flatter landscape. The altitudinal zonation of butterfly communities on both mountains was primarily due to the specificity of some red-listed species to high elevations, as well as to the preference of common butterfly species for low or intermediate altitudes. 3. Additive partitioning and null model analyses suggest an ecological redundancy on both mountains, as the environment is filtering species in terms of their environmental requirements rather than their functional position per se. Butterfly communities at high altitudes were not nested subsets of lowland communities. Environmental filtering led to the dominance of generalist species of which many were taxonomically close and had also similar life-history traits. 4. The application of complementary networks showed that butterfly SPecies of European conservation Concern (SPEC) are good surrogates of the overall butterfly fauna on both mountains.

However, determining minimum river inflows for management guidelines is hampered by a lack of ecosystem-flow link data. This study describes the development of freshwater inflow guidelines for the Wami Estuary, combining scarce river flow data, hydrological modeling, inferring natural salinity regime from vegetation zonation and investigating freshwater requirements of people/wildlife. By adopting the Building Blocks Methodology, a detailed Environmental Flows Assessment was performed to know the minimum water depth/quality seasonal requirements for vegetation, terrestrial/aquatic wildlife and human communities. Water depth requirements were assessed for drought and normal rainfall years; corresponding discharges were obtained by a hydrological model (HEC-RAS) developed for the river channel upstream of estuary. Recommended flows were well within historically occurring flows. However, given the rapidly increasing water demand coupled with reduction in basin water storage due to deforestation/wetland loss, it is critical to ensure these minimum flows are present, without which essential ecosystem services (fisheries, water quality, mangrove forest resources and wildlife/tourism) will be jeopardized.

The purpose of the study was to use geo-modeling of the soil cover for the territory of the “Basegi” Reserve (the Basegi Range, Middle Urals) using the method of generalized spatial analysis. For research, topographic maps, satellite images with high spatial resolution of up to 5 meters were used; GIS software; soil section data. In the course of work, large arrays of spatially distributed data were processed, which necessitated the structuring of information and the creation of databases. Based on the digital elevation model, the boundaries of geosystems of catchment areas and high-altitude plant formations are determined. For each plant group, the most favorable height range for their development is distinguished. Within the catchment areas of the rivers, the elements of their structural organization are distinguished: river channels, inner valley, sloping surfaces of the catchment, drainage funnels, fands, arcs. It has been established that basin formation is more active on the western slopes of the ridge, which leads to a “deformation” of the structure of the existing altitudinal zonation of the soil and vegetation cover. Electronic thematic maps on the main soil formation factors have been created for the territory of the “Basegi” Reserve. Based on a generalized spatial analysis, indicative relationships are established between vegetation, elevation, exposure and slope steepness, structural elements of the river catchment, and soils. Soil contours for the entire territory were digitized using satellite images, an automated method of decoding remote sensing data, taking into account all factors of soil formation. Geo-modeling of the soil cover on the basis of a generalized spatial analysis of the territory of the “Basegi” Reserve has allowed us to create a model of the structural organization of soils in space. The combined use of the basin method and geographic information technologies give high accuracy (80−90 %) when used for difficult natural conditions. © 2020 Lomonosov Moscow State University.

It is an area of outstanding universal value consisting of a freshwater ecosystem of 16 lakes divided by tufa barriers. Recently, this area has experienced pressure from visitors and significant infrastructural development. When the previous Management Plan expired in 2017, the PLNP initiated and adopted a new Management Plan. This involved the zonation of management in order to better conserve and use this protected area. Management zonation was based on spatial and other data on the distributions of the species and habitats (Natura 2000 and others); cultural values and geo-localities; visitor experiences; existing and planned infrastructure and settlements. Visitor classes and zones were determined using the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS) methodology. The new management zonation resulted in an increase of 13.9% in the area of the Park included in the Strict Conservation Zone, while succession and habitat degradation resulted in a decrease in the area of the Park in the Active Management Zone, especially in terms of grassland. Six ROS classes were defined. The established ROS classes and the new management zonation were interconnected, each reflecting the need to manage the protected area in terms of conserving its specific biodiversity and geodiversity, while offering visitors various experience opportunities and meeting the needs of the local community. © 2019 The Authors.","Management plan; Plitvice Lakes National Park; Protected area; ROS classes; Visitor pressure; Zonation","Croatia; Plitvice Lakes National Park; biodiversity; freshwater ecosystem; geodiversity; grassland; habitat fragmentation; infrastructural development; protected area; spatial planning; tufa; UNESCO; World Heritage Site; zonation","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084728435"

The Akanda National Park (ANP) in Gabon, almost exclusively constituted by mangroves, is part of a green belt of protected areas around the capital city of Libreville. The creation of the ANP is considered as an essential tool for the ecosystemic management of fisheries in Mondah Bay, playing nursery function for several exploited fish species. However, this role has never been documented in the mangroves of Gabon. The aim of this study is to describe the spatial and seasonal variability of fish assemblages, to assess ANP mangrove role as a nursery for fish juveniles. Fish sampling was carried out at four different sites in the four hydroclimatic seasons in Gabon using trammel gillnets with different mesh size (10, 27 and 40 mm). Fifty-nine fish species mainly estuarine and marine, first and second level predators were collected whatever the season and the site. The numerically dominant species were Pseudotolithus elongatus, Pellonula leonensis and Parachelon grandisquamis (48% of the total number of individuals), whereas P. elongatus, Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus and Plectorhinchus macrolepis represented the main biomasses (55%). The predominance in the catches of immature individuals of many species of commercial interest and in particular, P. elongatus, P. grandisquamis, C. nigrodigitatus, Eucinostomus melanopterus, Neochelon falcipinnis and Polydactylus quadrifilis, which dominate the community, highlights the importance of Akanda mangrove as a nursery for the juveniles of these species. The results of our study are a first step in understanding the fish communities of a Gabon marine protected area, which can support the decision making management plans, zonation and initiate a monitoring program for the estuarine and marine protected ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Communities; Conservation; Diversity; Fisheries; Mangroves; Nursery","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145320345"

We examine the degree to which the phylogenetic diversity of Victorian eucalypts is reserved within conservation areas. Based on modelled distributions of 101 eucalypt species and a phylogeny constructed from four molecular markers, we show that Victoria's conservation reserve system contains approximately a quarter of the eucalypt phylogenetic diversity. Some species do not exist at all within the reserve system. Large increases in reserved phylogenetic diversity could be achieved with small increases in the area set aside for conservation. Further, we show that any developments within Victoria's national parks should consider impacts on the reservation of eucalypt phylogenetic diversity.","Biological conservation; Phylogeny; Reserve design; Spatial conservation planning; Zonation","Australia; conservation planning; evergreen tree; genetic marker; national park; phylogenetics; phylogeny; reserve design; zonation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84990990372"

In inland alkali landscapes, elevation is a key factor for understanding patterns of salt accumulation and water table which is therefore considered a good indicator of alkali vegetation types. Remote sensing techniques offer viable solutions for linking elevation data to vegetation patterns by providing an elevation model of extended areas. Our goal was to test the relationships between fine-scale differences in vertical position and vegetation patterns in inland alkali landscapes by vegetation data collected in the field and elevation data generated using airborne laser scanning (ALS). We studied whether vertical position influences vegetation patterns at the level of main vegetation groups (based on alliances) or even at the level of associations. Our study sites were situated in a lowland alkali landscape in Hortobágy National Park (East-Hungary). We grouped the associations into four main vegetation groups: loess grasslands, alkali steppes, open alkali swards and alkali meadows. Even though we detected a very limited range (121. cm) in the vertical position of the main vegetation groups, they were well separated by their vertical positions. At the level of associations, a more detailed elevation-based distinction was also possible in many cases. The revealed elevation-vegetation correlations show that high-resolution mapping based on ALS remote sensing techniques is an ideal solution in complex lowland areas, such as alkali landscapes. Our findings suggest that in other types of lowland landscapes, characterised by elevation differences, the applied method might hold a great potential as a supporting tool for vegetation mapping. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.","Airborne laser scanning; Digital terrain model; Festucion pseudovinae; Natura 2000; Saline grassland; Vegetation zonation","Hortobagy; Hungary; bioindicator; digital terrain model; grassland; remote sensing; satellite data; vegetation mapping; water budget; zonation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930039557"

The Danube River regulation scheme implemented in the late 19th century considerably affected the Lobau area, which is part of the Danube National Park today. Terrestrialization processes in the floodplain started with the river regulation and pose an increasing threat to the aquatic and wetland vegetation of this ecosystem. Former vegetation studies were either directed toward phytosociological description of associations or to a general vegetation inventory and mapping, where transitions between vegetation types are not accounted for. Our purpose is to provide a detailed insight into the vegetation zonation pattern along the aquatic-terrestrial inundation gradient in the Lobau floodplain area. We sampled a total of 49 belt transects. Samples in each transect were classified into groups using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). Resulting groups of all transects were subjected to fuzzy c-mean clustering (FCM), defining ‘community types’ by means of indicator species analysis (ISA). We found 36 significant indicator species typifying 14 community types. Nine types belong to the shoreline vegetation and five types characterize the aquatic habitats. In addition to these community types, two transitional zones were found, one defined as open water/wetland transition and one as wetland/upland transition. Along the aquatic-terrestrial environmental gradient, different floristic and quantitative relations of community types and transition zones were identified. Finally, the importance of such a fine-scale description of zonation patterns along the inundation gradient is discussed in relation to long-term monitoring programmes as the basis for rehabilitation or wetland conservation measures. © 2016, Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.","classification; community types; ecocline; ecotone; ordination; shoreline vegetation; wetlands","Austria; Bratislava; Bratislavsky; Danube River; Slovakia; Vienna; aquatic environment; ecotone; macrophyte; oxbow lake; shoreline; terrestrial environment; vegetation dynamics; vegetation type; wetland","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961590531"

Extensive field surveys, topographic maps examination and aerial photographs interpretation have led to the production, within a GIS environment, of a new geomorphological map at 1:18,000 scale which outlines the main genesis and related landforms and deposits: (i) gravity-induced features, (ii) fluvial and runoff features, (iii) coastal features and (iv) anthropogenic features. Special attention has been given to the mapping of terraced slopes, which at present are extremely vulnerable to gravity-driven processes and running water because of extensive farmland abandonment. The output map is a fundamental basis for future activities of hazard assessment and zonation and the definition of land management strategies. © 2020 The Author(s).

The most significant recreational activity in the Tatry National Park has become sports, especially winter skiing. In the years 1970 - 2018 the areas of winter sports and recreational activities infrastructure expanded uninterrupted, especially at Štbské pleso, Tatranská Lomnica, Ždiar and Bachledova dolina.

The sampling was made following a hierarchical spatial design. The contribution in the variation around the mean of the intertidal limits of each organism at diverse spatial scales in the rocky shore was estimated with Linear Mixed Effects Model with software R. The majority of the species were found to increase their upper limits in the exposed coast of the two islands. Several intertidal algae, mainly the fucoids, were absent at the exposed shore and this pattern could be influenced by excessive turbulence. The variation at large spatial scales was related to changes in the degree of exposure between islands. Physical characteristics and biological interactions accounted for the variability observed on the intertidal. The spatial heterogeneity introduces variability from very small to mid spatial scale. The species presented in the low intertidal have more variation at small scale (meter to tens of meters), and the organisms in the high intertidal vary their limits at medium scale (tens to hundreds of meters).

We used in-situ conservation data to predict the potential habitat area of four flagship species: the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), golden monkey (Rhinopithecus roxella quinlingensis), takin (Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi), and crested ibis (Nipponia nippon). We then designed systematic conservation planning schemes for various scenarios given species habitat preferences and anthropogenic activities and conducted a cost-effectiveness assessment. Broadly, the geographical distributions of suitable habitats for giant pandas, golden monkeys, and takins exhibited high spatial congruence (correlation coefficients of 0.59–0.90), and areas of high congruence were concentrated in the northern portion of the Qinling Mountains at high elevation (>1500 m). By contrast, the crested ibis was negatively correlated in space with its sympatric species (−0.47 to −0.29). Crested ibis habitats were clustered in the southern portion of the region at low elevation (<1500 m). A hypothetical conservation priority area (CPA) based on the giant panda, golden monkey, and takin included 39.64% of the Qinling Mountains and 100%, 99.99%, 99.59%, and 7.84% of the suitable habitats for giant pandas, golden monkeys, takins, and crested ibises, respectively. The same area included 99.07%, 70.87%, and 39.96% of the highly important areas for the ecosystem services of biodiversity conservation, water supply, and soil retention, respectively, and only 4.62%, 16.83%, and 13.4% of the area were associated with high-density residential area, impervious surfaces, and cropland, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that a CPA approach based on the specialist species could result in effective, low-cost biodiversity conservation in the Qinling Mountains. However, we note that existing protected areas account for only 26.52% of the CPA. We recommend that the main area of the proposed Qinling National Park should be based on the CPA developed here. © 2021","Biodiversity; Ecosystem service; Ensemble model; Flagship species; Zonation","Animals; Anthropogenic Effects; Biodiversity; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Ecosystem; Ursidae; China; Qinling Mountains; biodiversity; conservation planning; ecosystem service; elevation; endangered species; habitat selection; specialist; animal experiment; article; China; conservation biology; correlation coefficient; cost effectiveness analysis; cropland; geographic distribution; giant panda; national park; nonhuman; residential area; Rhinopithecus; soil; species habitat; sympatry; takin; water supply; zonation; animal; bear; biodiversity; China; cost benefit analysis; ecosystem; environmental protection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121855203"

Our understanding of the sensitivity of Australian reptiles to elevational clines is limited. We examined lizard distribution across three elevation zones (montane, subalpine and alpine), spanning from 900 to 1840 m above sea level, in the Australian alps. We aimed to examine how elevation influences species diversity and abundance, and ectoparasite load, and whether species alter their habitat use amongst different elevational zones. Active searches were conducted across the elevation zones to identify lizard community structure (at least 16 species) across elevational zones, along with skink habitat preferences and the ectoparasite load. Skink diversity and abundance were negatively correlated with increased elevation. The alpine zone had significantly lower diversity and abundance of skinks. Habitat use differed amongst both elevations and species. Ectoparasite prevalence was also significantly diminished in the alpine zone. Ectoparasites only infected a subset of the skink community, with ectoparasite load increasing as the active season progressed.

Understanding patterns in spatial distribution of their species richness requires explicit consideration of different environmental drivers and their effects on functionally differing components. In this study, we assess the impact of both geographical and soil variables on the fine-scale (400 m2) pattern of plant diversity using field data from six national parks, spanning a 1300 m altitudinal gradient. Species richness and the slopes of species-area curves were calculated separately for the tree, shrub and herb layer and used as response variables in regression tree analyses. A cluster analysis distinguished three dominant forest communities with specific patterns in the diversity-environment relationship. The most widespread middle-altitude oak forests had the highest tree richness but the lowest richness of herbaceous plants due to a dense bamboo understory. Total richness was positively associated with soil reaction and negatively associated with soluble phosphorus and solar radiation (site dryness). Tree richness was associated mainly with soil factors, although trees are frequently assumed to be controlled mainly by factors with large-scale impact. A U-shaped relationship was found between herbaceous plant richness and altitude, caused by a distribution pattern of dwarf bamboo in understory. No correlation between the degree of canopy openness and herb layer richness was detected. Slopes of the species-area curves indicated the various origins of forest communities. Variable diversity-environment responses in different layers and communities reinforce the necessity of context-dependent differentiation for the assessment of impacts of climate and land-use changes in these diverse but intensively exploited regions. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Environmental conditions; Mixed forests; Plant diversity; Quercus mongolica; Species-area curves; Warm temperate zone","Korea; Quercus mongolica; altitudinal zonation; bamboo; cluster analysis; deciduous forest; deciduous tree; environmental conditions; land use change; mixed forest; mountain region; national park; phosphorus; regression analysis; slope; solar radiation; spatial distribution; species diversity; species richness; species-area relationship; temperate environment; temperate forest; understory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84872023006"

The stakeholders are divided into several groups: the government consists of central government and local government, private groups, local communities, and academics. Stakeholder roles and interests are divided into 4 (four quadrants), as subjects, key players, crowd, and context setters. The role of stakeholders within the WNP area can provide important information in the management of conservation areas. © 2017, BIOFLUX SRL.

This study is unique in that it applies the niche concept to moss and lichen distributions within Killarney National Park, Kerry, Ireland. We studied 75 trees between three pristine ancient woodlands and measured a range of physical and biological factors to ascertain influences on epiphyte cover. The species of tree was found as the principal determinant in community structure as it bioengineers conditions such as light, temperature and humidity that the epiphytes are reliant upon. Furthermore, the bark character and trunk circumference were important. Zonation of the epiphytes was apparent with both aspect and height on the trunk. Typically, moss dominated over lichen within a niche that was relatively sheltered. Lichen tolerated drier and lighter niches often being further up the trunk on sun facing aspects. Ultimately, there was succession up the tree mediated through competition. This study highlights the complexity and interrelatedness between biotic and abiotic factors in a relatively unstudied geographical and biological area.

Our aim in this paper is to analyse the results, based on each of these tools, using Marxan, a mapping software to obtain a zonation of a protect area in Mediterranean central Italy . The management algorithms of protected areas are widely used to identify potential networks of natural reserves that meet pre-established ecological limits, such as the presence of a specific percentage of habitats or a specific number of populations, at the same time minimizing costs. The Marxan software was made for different habitat where fragmentation of natural patches are significantly lower than in the study area, but it show interesting and useful result also in this situation. Marxan is particularly useful to solve the problem of the minimum set, in which the aim is to identify, at the lowest possible cost, the areas in which the biodiversity preconditions identified are present. In this work the Circeo National Park (Central Italy) was analysed, as an example of the Mediterranean area. We elaborated, through Marxan a series of maps of the priority areas for conservation that can be used as a starting point working with all the stakeholders involved in the management of the area itself. The main information suggests is to take particular attention to seasonal variations in the composition of the bird communities and, consequently, to the weight that the Park assumes at national and international level in the context of migratory movements and biodiversity conservation. In addition, special attention must be paid to the growing of intensive, rapidly expanding agricultural activities that are not enough controlled and are potentially highly damaging for the Park's biodiversity, both in terms of vegetation and fauna. © 2019 Centro Italiano Studi Ornitologici.

Soil characteristics are an essential information, especially to determine zonation at KBG. This research was conducted to describe soil fertility status at KBG through physical and chemical properties of soil (Cation Exchange Capacity/CEC, Base Saturation/BS, Soil Organic Carbon/C-Organic, Total Soil Phosphorus (total-P), and Total Soil Potassium (total-K)). Soil from eight locations were sampled by using a diagonal systematic and a purposive sampling method. Soil samples (9 sub sample points at each location) were mixed, then analyzed at Integrated Testing Laboratory in Vegetable Research Center (BALITSA) Lembang, Indonesia. Land in this research area is dominated by volcanic rocks with various levels of slope and soil fertility. Soil type divided into Andosol and Podzolic soils with soil textures dominated by clay and clay loam. CEC value at KBG is categorized as low to moderate (10.83 - 19.21 cmol/kg); BS value is categorized as low to very high (21 - 81 %); C-Organic is categorized as low to very high (1.33 - 7.05 %); total-P is categorized as high to very high (46.54 - 73.6 mg/100g); and total-K is categorized as low to high (7.25 - 44.67 mg/100g). The result also showed that Total Soil Nitrogen (total-N) at KBG is categorized as low to very high (0.15 - 0.78 %) and soil pH levels around 5.2 to 6.3.

Its implementation has led to the re-territorialisation of 66 biosphere reserves, as they have been extended beyond the protected areas that form their ‘core areas’. One example is Wester Ross in northwest Scotland. This region has been nationally recognised for its high biodiversity and landscape values since the late 1940s, and a small biosphere reserve was established in 1976. In the current decade, as required by the MAB Programme, this biosphere reserve was extended to over 100 times its original area through a participatory process which is described in detail. Following re-territorialisation, this biosphere reserve, like others, both represents opportunities and faces challenges.

Galliformes is a globally endangered avian order vulnerable to climate change that provide an important indicator for wildlife conservation effectiveness. Here, we identified priority areas for conserving Galliformes taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity in China and their spatial dynamics subject to climate change, and examined how well existing protected areas align with current and future priority areas. Location: China. Methods: We applied species distribution modelling and Zonation algorithms to identify conservation priority area dynamics for 47 galliform species across three biodiversity indexes subject to three future climate change scenarios to 2050s and 2070s. We overlaid these identified priority areas onto existing national nature reserves and national parks to assess and project their effectiveness. Results: Current priority areas proved spatially incongruent between indexes, with an optimal area overlap comprising just 10.3% of China's land area, lying largely outside of existing protected areas. Furthermore, over 80% of modelled optimal priority areas currently lacked formal conservation status. Future priority areas will shift substantially under climate change, to an extent dependent on greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Nevertheless, we identified five large regions where optimal Galliformes diversity indexes should remain stable under all scenarios, thus providing potential climatic refugia, if protected from human encroachment. Main Conclusions: The current deficits we identified for Galliformes protection in China resonate with a broader need for hierarchical conservation strategic planning across regions and ecosystems to ensure long-term biodiversity protection, accommodating for climate change. © 2022 The Authors.

Taking into consideration the mountainous topography of the study area, the watershed was chosen as the planning unit, and ecotope mapping was carried out to identify topographic and biological features. For the evaluation of the state of recent use, the trail index and the distribution status of tour and management facilities were used. These features were processed using Marxan with Zones. As a result, the optimal solution of scenario 1 was selected as the final one following detailed verification of the area ratio and grouping of the Park Nature Conservation Area (zone A, 76.7%) and the Park Nature Environment Area (I) (zone B, 14.3%), the inclusion ratio of biotope grade I (95.2%) and the satisfied shortfall value of the conservation indicators. In the overlap analysis between the optimal solution and recent zonation, most of the features included in the suggested scenario were found to be correctly distributed according to the intensity of conservation. Furthermore, the northern parts of the watershed which include sub-alpine vegetation with the Baekdudaegan ridge as its ecological axis was newly separated into the Park Conservation Area.

We present new geochemical data and applications of existing barometric and chronometric tools to interrogate the mantle source compositions, crustal storage depths, and ascent timescales of a primitive, high-Mg, clinopyroxene-bearing cinder cone, the basaltic andesite of Box Canyon, located in the vicinity of Lassen Volcanic National Park, CA, in the southern Cascades. Petrographic examination in addition to bulk and in situ geochemical analyses (XRF, LA-ICP-MS, and EPMA) of tephra and lava-derived samples reveals co-crystallization of clinopyroxene and olivine as phenocrysts and glomerocrysts with ~ Mg# 80 and > Fo85, respectively. Phase equilibria experiments of analogous Cascade Arc magma compositions estimate crustal storage of the observed phase assemblage at pressures in the lower crust > 700 MPa. Reverse zonation in olivine and clinopyroxene phenocryst interiors from core-rim analytical profiles record a lower crustal mafic mixing event. Results from one-dimensional, multi-elemental olivine and clinopyroxene diffusion models fit to these interior mixing zones provide an assessment of available trace element (Ti, La, Yb, Ce, and Nd) diffusion chronometers in clinopyroxene by considering multiple element profiles within two phases that experienced the same pre-eruptive conditions. While multi-elemental and multi-phase diffusion timescales span two to three orders of magnitude, Ni in olivine profiles provide the most-robust estimate of 19.1 ± 8.6 years from mixing-to-eruption. Our results provide new constraints on arc crustal differentiation processes, indicate rapid crustal transit timescales in agreement with a growing database of diffusion-based ascent timescales of basaltic magmas, and demonstrate significant, systematic deviation of diffusion timescales calculated from natural zonation of rare earth elements in clinopyroxene and Ti in clinopyroxene and olivine. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cinder cones; Clinopyroxene; High-mg basaltic andesites; Lassen; Magma storage","Cascade Range; United States; andesite; basalt; clinopyroxene; crustal structure; lava flow; magma; petrogenesis; petrology; tephra","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089959460"

Their efforts to use natural sources often collide with wildlife attacks. These animals do not only protect their natural environment, but in the face of losing the potential food sources, they also penetrate in human settlements. The research was situated in the Chitwan National Park (CNP) in Nepal, and the aim of this study was to investigate possible geospatial connections between attacks of all kinds of animals on humans in the CNP and its surroundings between 2003 and 2013. The patterns of attacks were significantly uneven across the months, and 89% of attacks occurred outside the park. In total, 74% attacks occurred in the buffer zone forests and croplands within 1 km from the park. There was a strong positive correlation among the number of victims for all attacking animals with a maximum of one victim per 4 km2, except elephant and wild boar. The density of bear victims was higher where the tiger and rhino victims were lower, e.g., in the Madi valley. The data collected during this period did not show any signs of spatial autocorrelation. The calculated magnitude per unit area using the kernel density, together with purpose-defined land use groups, were used to determine five risk zones of wildlife attacks. In conclusion, it was found that the riskiest areas were locations near the forest that were covered by agricultural land and inhabited by humans.

This study linked longitudinal patterns of the physicochemical habitat and macroinvertebrate community along a New Zealand glacier-fed river and compared and contrasted these with understanding of European alpine river systems. Habitat variables and benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled over two consecutive summer melt periods at three sites along the Rob Roy stream, a tributary of the Matukituki River, in Mt Aspiring National Park near Wanaka, South Island. Although habitat stability increased downstream from the glacier terminus (Site R1), disturbance remained a limiting factor of macroinvertebrate abundance and species richness at the lower sites (R2 and R3). An average water temperature increase of 2 °C over 3·3 km (from R1 to R3) was observed downstream with habitat heterogeneity and species richness highest at the downstream site (R3). The ephemeropterans Deleatidium cornutum and Nesameletus dominated at the upper two sites with the chironomids Eukiefferiella and Maoridiamesa, but became co-dominant at R3 with Deleatidium angustum, where other plecopteran and trichopteran taxa were also observed. Distributions were predominantly limited by temperature, thought to be due to adaptation to disturbance observed in taxa of New Zealand alpine streams. However, the plecopteran Zelandobius, although tolerant of cool temperatures, appeared limited to areas and periods when channel stability was higher. Modification of the conceptual model of the longitudinal zonation of macroinvertebrate taxa (Milner et al., 2001a) is proposed to account for the different species assemblage of New Zealand glacier-fed rivers. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd..","Algae; Disturbance; Glacier; Habitat; Hydroecology; Macroinvertebrates; New Zealand; Southern Alps; Water temperature","Matukituki River; New Zealand; Otago; South Island; Southern Alps; algae; Chironomidae; Deleatidium; Ephemeroptera; Eukiefferiella; Maoridiamesa; Nesameletus; Plecoptera; Trichoptera; Catchments; Ecosystems; Parks; Rivers; Temperature; Disturbance; Habitat; Hydro-ecology; Macroinvertebrates; New zealand; Southern Alps; Water temperature; alga; catchment; endemic species; environmental disturbance; glacial hydrology; habitat structure; macroinvertebrate; river system; species richness; temperature effect; water temperature; Glaciers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960542560"

Spatial variability of amphipod species composition and functional traits were studied over a 3 year period during the summer season at five intertidal transects of the Gulf of Kachchh (GoK) MPAs, India. A total of 22,706 individuals, comprising 71 species belonging to 40 genera and 23 families, were identified. Aoridae, Dexaminidae, Eriopisidae, Lysianassidae, and Maeridae were the best represented families (68.2% of total abundance). Distinct spatial patterns in the amphipod assemblage structure and functional traits were observed along the horizontal and vertical axes. The results demonstrated that the amphipod assemblage functioning was greatly influenced by the vertical gradient, with generally higher functional diversity (FD) in the lower intertidal zones suggesting increased diversity in resource use strategies, whereas the upper zones showed very little FD possibly due to the prevalence of environmental filtering. As higher species and functional diversities promote better resource partitioning and resilience of the ecosystem, these results are important for the management of MPAs facing the dual challenges of global climate change and anthropogenic pressures. © Copyright © 2020 Srinivas, Sukumaran, Neetu and Ramesh Babu.","amphipod; functional traits; fuzzy coding; intertidal; Marine National Park; vertical zonation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096683541"

Accuracy in species detection usually requires temporal replication at sampling sites, a time-consuming and costly monitoring scheme. Here, we applied a lower-cost alternative based on a double-sampling approach to incorporate the reliability of species detection into regression-based species distribution modelling. Location Doñana National Park (south-western Spain). Methods Using species-specific monthly detection probabilities, we estimated the detection reliability as the probability of having detected the species given the species-specific survey time. Such reliability estimates were used to account explicitly for data uncertainty by weighting each absence. We illustrated how this novel framework can be used to evaluate four competing hypotheses as to what constitutes primary environmental control of amphibian distribution: breeding habitat, aestivating habitat, spatial distribution of surrounding habitats and/or major ecosystems zonation. The study was conducted on six pond-breeding amphibian species during a 4-year period. Results Non-detections should not be considered equivalent to real absences, as their reliability varied considerably. The occurrence of Hyla meridionalis and Triturus pygmaeus was related to a particular major ecosystem of the study area, where suitable habitat for these species seemed to be widely available. Characteristics of the breeding habitat (area and hydroperiod) were of high importance for the occurrence of Pelobates cultripes and Pleurodeles waltl. Terrestrial characteristics were the most important predictors of the occurrence of Discoglossus galganoi and Lissotriton boscai, along with spatial distribution of breeding habitats for the last species. Main conclusions We did not find a single best supported hypothesis valid for all species, which stresses the importance of multiscale and multifactor approaches. More importantly, this study shows that estimating the reliability of non-detection records, an exercise that had been previously seen as a naïve goal in species distribution modelling, is feasible and could be promoted in future studies, at least in comparable systems. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Absence reliability; Data uncertainty; False absence; Species detectability; Temporary ponds","Andalucia; Donana National Park; Mediterranean Region; Spain; Amphibia; Discoglossus galganoi; Hyla meridionalis; Pelobates cultripes; Pleurodeles waltl; Salamandroidea; Triturus boscai; Triturus pygmaeus; detection method; estimation method; feasibility study; frog; habitat type; hydroperiod; integrated approach; monitoring; pond; population distribution; population modeling; regression analysis; reliability analysis; reproductive behavior; spatial distribution; species occurrence; survey","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856803250"

Botanical and environmental data were collected along some 4000 m of linear transects from the area surrounding Mubwindi Swamp, BINP. Ordination using Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) and classification using Two-way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) successfully identified four different species assemblages. These forest types were then named on the basis of the ecological characteristics of the species within the group, and the environmental conditions influencing the distribution and past disturbance of the forest. The techniques used were in agreement for three out of the four forest types identified. Analysis using an environmental overlay showed a significant association between forest type and altitude.

Understanding the mode of life of this extinct group of gastropods is crucial for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. The knowledge on their ecology is, however, limited by the near absence of comparable large high-spired gastropods in Recent carbonate systems. Large high-spired turritellid gastropods are, however, abundant in siliciclastic-dominated environments in the tropical Indian Ocean. In order to compare the Recent and fossil environments of these two morphologically similar groups, a Recent tidal flat, where abundant turritellids occur, was studied in the National Park of Nopparat Thara in the district of Krabi, South Thailand. Ninety specimens of Turritella duplicata were measured and mapped, revealing zonations in population distribution, both parallel and perpendicular to the beach line. Attention was also paid to other faunal elements and sedimentary features. The thus-gained information on the depositional environment was then compared to a section of shallow-water carbonate deposits from the Kimmeridgian of the Swiss Jura Mountains. These are characterised by the occurrence of tidal laminites, dinosaur tracks, beach deposits and nerineoid gastropods. Especially for one succession, the faunal composition and sedimentary structures in the fossil record show intriguing similarities to those found today on the Nopparat Thara tidal flat, indicating that it formed in a comparable setting. It is therefore suggested that for some Kimmeridgian carbonate deposits, the Nopparat Thara tidal flat, although dominantly siliciclastic, represents an environmental analogue. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Jurassic; Nerineoidea; Nopparat Thara tidal flat; Palaeoecology; Switzerland; Turritellidae","Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Tropical); Jura Mountains; Krabi; Southern Region; Switzerland; Thailand; Dinosauria; Gastropoda; Nerineoidea; Turritella duplicata; Turritellidae; abundance; carbonate system; depositional environment; fossil record; gastropod; morphology; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; population distribution; tidal flat","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79952576003"

In the high-elevation Andes, human-induced fragmentation has exacerbated the patchy distribution of Polylepis forests, threatening their unique biological communities and spurring restoration interest. Studies of Polylepis forest extent in Peru suggest that forest borders have remained stable over the past century despite decreasing anthropogenic disturbance, suggesting that tree seedling recruitment is being limited in the open grassland habitat. We studied natural seedling dispersion patterns of Polylepis sericea and Polylepis weberbaueri (Rosaceae) at forest–grassland edges across a range of environmental conditions to examine seedling recruitment and colonization of grasslands in Huascaran National Park (Peru). Using data from 2367 seedlings found in 48 forest–grassland edge plots (15 m × 15 m) at forest patches between 3900–4500 masl, we employed generalized mixed modelling to identify the significant associations of seedling densities with environmental covariates. In addition, we compared these associations to patterns of adult presence on the landscape. Seedling densities were associated with a combination of variables varying within (distance to forest edge) and among (elevation and dry season solar irradiation) plots across the landscape. For both species, seedling densities decreased with increasing distance away from the forest in a manner consistent with short-distance seed dispersal by wind. Our results suggest that such short-distance dispersal may slow forest expansion, but that there also appear to be substantial post-dispersal limitations to seedling establishment in the grassland. Polylepis sericea densities decreased with elevation, while P. weberbaueri increased with elevation and decreased with solar irradiation. Associations of adult presence with elevation and solar irradiation mirrored those of seedling densities. Management of areas with forest patches dominated by these species should consider these differences in their environmental tolerances, particularly during species selection and zonation for reforestation. © 2018 Ecological Society of Australia","colonization; forest expansion; forest–grassland boundaries; Polylepis spp.; seedling recruitment","Ancash; Andes; Huascaran National Park; Peru; Polylepis; Polylepis sericea; Polylepis weberbaueri; Rosaceae; angiosperm; anthropogenic effect; colonization; dry season; ecotone; elevation; environmental conditions; forest ecosystem; forest edge; grassland; habitat fragmentation; habitat restoration; range expansion; reforestation; regeneration; seed dispersal; seedling establishment; tolerance; treeline; tropical environment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044391593"

Foraminifera inhabiting the muddy substrates were found to represent a unique assemblage and are distinct from other nearshore biotas. A total of twenty one benthic species were recorded. Numerical analyses of faunal assemblages indicate that the distribution of taxa is vertically constrained, divided into two faunal zones that are elevation dependent. A low-diverse agglutinated foraminiferal assemblage, dominated by Ammotium salsum and Ammobaculites pseudospirale, was found to characterize the elevated landward field area in muddy substrates around Avicennia germinans mangroves. The assemblage is composed of agglutinated taxa only and is indicative for High Mean Water Neap Tide elevations. A moderately diverse assemblage of agglutinated and calcareous foraminifera was recovered from around Rhizomosa racemose stands and represents biotas at Mean Low Water Neap Tide elevation. The assemblage is dominated by species of Miliammina, Arenoporella mexicana, Ammotium salsum and Astrononion stelligerum. The species richness of individual assemblages was found to be tide-related and reveals a strong trend of decreasing diversity moving up the shore.

The greater hydrological connectivity established in the rainy season promoted the homogenisation of most environmental variables and fish species, which differed markedly from the arrangement observed in the dry season. Despite variation in fish species composition, community attributes showed non-significant differences between the dry and rainy seasons. The patterns of composition and numerical density in pools were strongly influenced by local factors, especially salinity, dissolved oxygen, total phosphorous concentration and water colour in the dry season, in addition to total nitrogen concentration and depth in the rainy season. Comparable to the role played by flood pulses in river-floodplain systems, the hydrological connectivity in these tropical coastal waterbodies seems to strongly influence fish community structure, and, therefore to determine regional biodiversity. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Coastal lagoons; Fish community structure; Hydrological connectivity; Metacommunity; Neotropical fishes","Pisces","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77949876897"

Some ungulate species demonstrate consistent birth site fidelity, while others shift birth locations during their lifetimes as a function of ecological and social factors. We plotted 39 years of birth records from a wild population of Thornicroft's giraffe, Giraffa camelopardalis thornicrofti, to test the hypothesis that giraffe use consistent locations for birth. Data from 29 calves born to nine females revealed that birth seasonality was absent and that ecological zone had no significant impact on birth locations. Consecutive births by individual females were not limited to certain locations, with the distance between sequential birth sites tending to be greater if a calf failed to survive the first year of life. Our evidence conflicts with the suggestion that giraffe cows regularly return to special locations for bearing calves. We suggest that the choice of birth location is a function of nonseasonal breeding, predator pressure and extensive variation in microhabitat characteristics within ecological zones. Female giraffe have evolved a flexible reproductive strategy, whereby they regulate choice of birth site location based upon their past reproductive history, current ecological conditions (including both resource availability and predator pressure) and present social surroundings. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Giraffe; Habitat; Life history; Parturition; Predation; Reproductive strategies","South Luangwa National Park; Zambia; Giraffa camelopardalis; Giraffidae; Ungulata; birth rate; cattle; ecological zonation; habitat selection; hypothesis testing; life history trait; reproductive strategy; reproductive success; site fidelity; ungulate","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928359285"

Much controversy has arisen surrounding this decision as the new category allows forest harvesting practices in most of the natural protected area. We assessed the forest cover loss in the Nevado de Toluca protected area and a 20 km buffer zone around it, before and after the change in protection status, and we established a map of forest types in view of assessing biodiversity vulnerability to the protection change in the forest harvesting areas. The forest type classification was carried out applying a Random Forest algorithm to Sentinel-2 imagery. The forest cover loss was assessed using the Landsat-based Global Forest Watch product during the period 2001–2019. Forest cover loss increased after the change of the Nevado de Toluca protection status; 39.7 hectares/year (± 16.7 ha/year) between 2001 and 2013 versus 106.0 hectares/year (± 40.2 ha/year) between 2014 and 2019. Clear-cut deforestation occurred in 49.6 hectares during year 2018. According to our forest map, 7171 ha (54.8%) of the Abies religiosa forest and 6511 ha (32.5%) of the pine forests of the Nevado de Toluca protected area are inside the forest harvesting zonation. Also, forest cover loss around the natural protected area has increased, especially in 2018, indicating that allowing forest harvesting practices in the natural protected area has not reduced the pressure in the surrounding forests either. We ponder the consequences of the category change and give some suggestions for the future of the forests in the Nevado de Toluca protected area. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Abies religiosa forests; Forest harvesting; Global forest cover change; Logging; Natural protected areas; Satellite imagery","Mexico [Mexico (NTN)]; Mexico [North America]; Nevado de Toluca; Toluca; biodiversity; buffer zone; deforestation; forest cover; harvesting; logging (timber); protected area; satellite imagery; volcano","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124606288"

We then assessed the performance of the existing PA network relative to land exploitation pressure and evaluated conservation effectiveness of PA expansion for the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The Zonation software was used to spatially prioritize conservation areas to minimize biodiversity loss and the extinction risk for 8077 Japanese vascular plant and vertebrate species under constraints of the existing PA network and land use. The spatial pattern of the identified priority areas, which were considered candidate areas for expansion of the current PA network, was influenced by land-use types according to the mask layers of non-PAs, and low-, middle-, and high-ranked PAs. The current PA network reduced the aggregate extinction risk of multiple species by 36.6%. Indeed, the proportion of built-up areas in the existing PAs was generally smaller than that in the areas surrounding PAs. Notably, high-ranked PAs effectively restricted the built-up pressure (0.04% every 10 years), whereas low-ranked PAs in national park and wild-life protection areas did not (1.8% every 10 years). Conservation effects were predicted to substantially improve by expansion of high-ranked (legally strict) PAs into remote non-PAs without population/socioeconomic activities, or expansion of medium-ranked PAs into satoyama which have traditionally been used for agriculture and forestry, and urban areas. A 30% land conservation target was predicted to decrease extinction risk by 74.1% when PA expansion was implemented across remote areas, satoyama, and urban areas; moreover, PA connectivity almost doubled compared with the existing PA network. In contrast, a conventional scenario showed that placing national parks in state-owned and non-populated areas would reduce extinction risk by only 4.0%. Conservation prioritization analyses demonstrated the effectiveness of using a comprehensive conservation approach that reconciles land-sparing protection and land-sharing conservation in other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) in satoyama and urban green spaces. Our results revealed that complementary inclusion of various PA interventions related to their governance and land-use planning plays a critical role in effectively preventing biodiversity loss and makes it more feasible to achieve ambitious conservation targets. © 2021","Connectivity; Land sharing/sparing; OECM; Satoyama; Spatial prioritization; Zonation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114143071"

Detailed facies mapping permitted critical assessment of depositional processes operating along this structurally dynamic platform margin. At the shelf crest, thick (12 m), vertically stacked fenestral-pisolite-tepee complexes indicate a stable shoreline. Early lithification of sediments and extensive cementation fostered rapid vertical accretion and allowed the shelf crest to easily adjust to base-level oscillations by stepping landward, stepping seaward, or aggrading. This production imbalance-in combination with syndepositional brittle failure and down-to-the-basin tilting(< 5°)-generated 22 m of depositional relief as measured from nearly horizontal (< 2°) shelf-crest toplap to an outer-shelf downlap surface (< 1°). Mechanical failure of Capitan-equivalent back-reef strata is constrained by stratigraphic architecture, fracture properties, and a highly refined fusulinid biostratigraphic framework. Where fractures tip out, down-to-the-basin rotation is often observed with concurrent seaward thickening of overlying beds, indicating that such fractures functioned as a syndepositional hinge. A facies disjunction and horizontally juxtaposed fusulinid zonation were documented across an 80° seaward-dipping dilational fracture filled with polymict breccia. An overlying damage zone consisting of spar-cemented fractures nested within silt-filled fractures illustrates periodic reactivation. Field relationships indicate that the dilational fracture approximates a paleoescarpment that resulted from catastrophic failure of the Capitan platform margin. Younger strata onlapped the paleoescarpment and gradually filled the reentrant. This mechanically compromised paleoescarpment was subsequently reactivated during the latest Guadalupian lowstand and was subaerially filled by siliciclastics and polymict breccia derived from the platform top. Results from Walnut Canyon indicate that shelf crest aggradation dominantly controlled the shelf-crest to outer-shelf profile, although this was temporarily modified by brittle failure and down-to-the-basin tilting, and mass wasting.

Results indicate that the overall cleanliness of the campsite is an important attribute that affects the visitor experience. The Ecotourist segment reported environmentally desired motives, attitudes and behaviours. However, majority of campsite users belong to the Prestige-seeker and Adventure-seeker segments. Prestige seekers in particular demand better facilities and proper maintenance of campsites. Additionally, Prestige seekers are more attractive as a market segment to target because they are high-income, well-educated individuals with pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors.

Cluster analysis of 1971-2000 temperature and precipitation normals grouped weather stations according to similarities in seasonal patterns. Principal Components Analysis (PCAs) of 1895-2008 monthly data grouped stations by similarities in long-term variability. Finally, an analysis of snow data further subdivided the zones defined by the other two analyses. The climate zones produced by the cluster analysis and the PCAs were roughly similar to each other, but the differences were significant. The two sets of zones may be useful for different applications. For example, studies that analyze links between climate patterns and the demography of threatened species should focus on the results of the PCAs. The broad similarity among results produced by the different approaches supported the application of these zones in climate- related monitoring and analysis.

Several biological and physical factors change the rocky shore communities. The desiccation time and the tolerance of the intertidal species produce the vertical zonation. In many studies around the world, a temporal change in this zonation is presented. In Costa Rica, only studies that include temporal trends were carried out in Punta Mala and Montezuma, Pacific coast in 80's. The rocky intertidal of the Cocos Island National Park, Costa Rica were surveyed photographically. The Chatham bay was sampled in three expeditions (January 2007, October 2007 and April 2008). Photos corresponding to 25×25cm quadrats were taken with the goal to determine diversity and composition differences in rocky shore organisms between sampling dates. The Wafer bay was sampled in January and October 2007. The intertidal of Chatham consists of basaltic rock, while Wafer has basaltic and ignimbrite boulders. The main difference between sites were the higher algae cover (erect-frondose forms) and number of organism bands at Chatham bay. Temporal change was not found in the total cover of sessile fauna and autotrophs. The barnacle Tetraclita stalactifera, that occurs above the algal fringe (lower intertidal), was the invertebrate with the highest coverage. The mobile fauna biodiversity presented no significant trend between sampled months. However, the identity of species, their cover and their abundance showed a moderate temporal change. In October 2007, when the sea surface temperature was 23°C the infralittoral zone had an increase in green algae cover. The red algae (crust and erect-frondose forms) were dominant in January and April. The pulmonate limpet, Siphonaria gigas and a bacterial biofilm at mid littoral showed a negative association. The snails of the high littoral and the supralittoral zone showed a temporal change in their abundance, but with contrasting patterns between sites. The temporal variation in the assemblages increased from the supralittoral to the infralittoral possibly due to changes in the water temperature and climatic conditions, that could influence the intertidal zone during the high and low tide, respectively.","Isla del Coco; Temporal change; Tropical rocky intertidal; Vertical zonation","Animals; Biodiversity; Biomass; Costa Rica; Ecosystem; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Principal Component Analysis; Seasons; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chlorophyta; Gastropoda; Invertebrata; Montezuma; Rhodophyta; Siphonaria gigas; Tetraclita stalactifera; Thoracica; animal; article; biodiversity; biomass; comparative study; Costa Rica; ecosystem; population density; population dynamics; principal component analysis; season","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650697337"

Here, we highlight changes in the insect species richness and community composition of wild bees, butterflies and moths over 60 years in an area situated above the tree limit (Padjelanta National Park) in northern Sweden. Although there were changes in habitat availability, indicated by a significant decrease in the area of a glacier (from 22 km 2 in 1898 to 7.5 km 2 in 2009), and an increase in the area of birch forest in the National Park, we nevertheless found relatively moderate changes in the insect communities. Indeed, the observed number of species increased from 52 in 1944 to 64 in 2008. Remarkably, the mean number of butterflies and moths per site, but not wild bee species, increased significantly. Among the species that were recorded in both periods, the average altitude of 17 species had shifted downhill, 12 shifted uphill, and the altitude of the remaining 17 had not changed. While alterations in community composition were greater at the highest altitudes, changes in the insect community were smaller than expected, indeed much smaller than those reported from agricultural landscapes in North-West Europe. Interestingly, our results suggest that lower alpine altitudes (600-800 m a. s. l.) have become colonized by southern species, but also that high alpine areas (above 1,000 m a. s. l.) have recently become colonized by high alpine species previously absent from these sites, likely as a result of increasing habitat availability. We conclude that wild bee, butterfly, and moth communities in Arctic areas in northern Sweden are in flux, as a result of climate change and suggest that increased attention must be given to conservation planning in cold areas. In addition, we propose that monitoring programs should be established, because more pronounced climate-driven changes can be expected in the future. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Alpine; Bumble bees; Butterflies; Climate change; Moths; Padjelanta National Park","Norrbotten; Padjelanta National Park; Sweden; Apoidea; Arthropoda; Bombus (genus); Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; Papilionoidea; altitudinal zonation; arctic environment; biomonitoring; climate change; climate effect; community composition; glacier retreat; habitat availability; insect; mountain region; pollinator","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84858150796"

It is challenging to protect large-ranging carnivores like tigers under increasing pressure of human development. To provide a more technically robust foundation for tiger habitat conservation prioritization, we conducted a comprehensively empirical analysis based on a broadly collected occurrence dataset of tigers and their prey. We modeled tiger distribution by running an ensemble model integrating nine different algorithms. We found that the ensemble model performed well and outperformed any individual model regarding the discrimination ability. We used cumulative resistant kernel analysis to identify core habitats as with high predicted movement density and used factorial least-cost paths to model corridors among tiger occurrence locations. We found that core habitats for Amur tigers are distributed in three mountain areas, namely, eastern Wanda Mountain, southern Zhangguangcailing, and Laoyeling-Dalongling. We found significant protection gaps as existing protected areas only cover less than one-fourth of predicted core habitats, but this proportion will rise significantly with the establishment of the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park. Furthermore, we ranked spatial priorities for the expansion of the protected area network, simultaneously considering biological and socioeconomic dimensions under the Zonation framework. Our study presented the most up-to-date and detailed maps of the predicted potential distribution and area of the most important habitats for the Amur tigers in China, which can provide quantitative guidance in the effort to maximize the efficiency of conservation initiatives at a regional scale. © 2021 The Authors.","BIOMOD; ensemble forecasting; factorial least-cost paths; multi-scale habitat selection; resistant kernel; species distribution models; zonation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115805587"

Twenty-five soil surface samples were collected along an interior wetland transect and an estuarine mangrove transect across coastal zones in the Everglades National Park and subjected to palynological and XRF analyses. Modern pollen spectra from the sampling sites were classified into five a priori groups-wet prairie, pineland, inland mangroves, coastal mangroves, and fringe mangroves, based on the five vegetation types and sub-environments from which they were collected. Discriminant analysis shows that all (100%) of the samples are correctly classified into their a priori groups. On a broad scale, the modern pollen assemblages in surface samples collected from different vegetation types reflect the primary environmental gradient in the Florida Coastal Everglades. A distinct salinity and chemical gradient is also recorded in the XRF results, and the complexity of these gradients is captured at both regional and local scales. At the regional scale, concentrations of all the elements increase from terrestrial toward coastal sites. At the local scale, XRF results show a progressive decrease in most chemical concentrations and in the Cl/Br and Ca/Ti ratios away from the Shark River Slough at each individual site, suggesting that a secondary fluvial/tidal gradient also exists locally as a function of the distance from the river, the main carrier of these chemicals. This study provides new evidence to show that tidal flooding from the Shark River Estuary is directly related to the nutrient availability in the surrounding mangrove forests. These data will deepen our understanding of the environmental drivers behind the vegetation zonation in the region, especially in the mangrove ecosystems, and fill a gap in the pollen data network for the Everglades. © 2018 Yao and Liu.","Coastal environmental gradients; Everglades National Park; Mangroves; Shark river slough; Surface pollen assemblages; X-ray fluorescence (XRF)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041369813"

Research was conducted in sixteen forest plots the Jaú National Park. In these, epiphytes on all phorophytes with DBH ≥ 10 cm were identified. We measured flood height using the watermark left by the last high-water period, then estimated the height relative to the ground of every epiphytic individual. We recorded 653 individuals in 37 species, distributed on 109 phorophytes. Igapó floodplain forests have much lower richness and abundance of vascular epiphyte species than do other Amazonian forests. This may reflect the limitation of available sites for colonization (only 24.9% of studied trees were occupied by epiphytes). Holoepiphytes predominated, and the combined presence of a flood-pulse, linked to the nutrient-poor soil poor seems to limit the occurrence of nomadic vines. Horizontal distribution of epiphytes followed the distribution of phorophytes, which in turn followed the flood-level gradient. Also flooding interacted strongly with vertical zonation to determine species richness. As already well-reported for trees, and unlike reports of epiphytes in other floodplains, flooding strongly influenced richness and distribution of vascular epiphytes in the studied igapó forests. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Flood pulse; Horizontal distribution; Igapó; Vertical distribution; Wetlands","Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; Jau National Park; abundance; colonization; dominance; epiphyte; floodplain; spatial distribution; species richness; vascular plant; vertical distribution; vine; wetland","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042602126"

The study was performed during 2003-2004 in Los Alerces National Reserve, Argentina. The huemul fresh signs were intensively sought and registered on transects distributed at random as evidence of habitat use. The transects were laid perpendicular to the contour lines, running continuously from low to high elevations. The sampling points were placed on each contour line to evaluate the availability of the vegetation types. We used a nonmapping technique and the Bonferroni confidence intervals to analyze the habitat selection on a seasonal basis. The huemul signs were found at elevations that varied significantly across the seasons. The seasonal distribution of the signs showed that during autumn and winter, the huemul selected the lenga (Nothofagus pumilio) forests and high shrublands, respectively, and the high-Andean vegetation in summer. The observed pattern of habitat selection reflects the movements from the high elevations in summer to the low elevations in winter. This pattern appeared to be influenced by food availability. The protection of the habitat, ranging from the low valleys to the mountain-top areas, and the actions to reduce human pressure in the low elevations appear critical for the conservation of the huemul populations.","Altitudinal movements; Argentina; Habitat selection; Hippocamelus bisulcus; Nothofagus forests; Patagonia","Andes; Argentina; Chubut; Los Alerces National Park; Patagonia; altitudinal zonation; contour map; endangered species; food availability; habitat conservation; habitat selection; habitat use; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation type","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887651668"

Callichirus kraussi was broadly distributed, occupying most of the intertidal area, whereas U. africana was confined to the head of the lagoon or beds of eelgrass in the upper sections of intertidal zones. Upogebia capensis was prominent in subtidal areas, occupying deeper areas below the zonation of C. kraussi. Callichirus rotundicaudata was rare. The distribution of the different species of prawns was related to sediment characteristics, with C. kraussi dominant in intertidal sandy areas, U. africana in high-shore vegetated zones and intertidal areas at the head of the lagoon where sediments were finer and had a high mud content, and U. capensis in subtidal areas with similarly fine sediments.

The altitude zone common in the territory of the national park is up to 350 m above sea level. The purpose of this work is to study the microbiological and biochemical properties of soils formed under conditions of a gradient of altitude zonation. This work was performed for the first time in this territory. Based on the fatty acid composition of the cell walls of microorganisms, the composition and structure of the microbial community were determined by chemato-mass spectrometry. The dominant microbocenosis of soils of undisturbed territories was revealed. Changes in prokaryotes and microscopic fungi in the gradient of the altitude zone occur in different directions, which is consistent with the work of other researchers. The results suggest that the formation of microbocenosis of soils located in different conditions of the phytocenotic environment depends on the location of the site relative to the height. The latter determines the flow of solar energy into the ecosystem and the hydrothermal regime of soils. The data obtained can be used in monitoring global climate changes, will become the basis for the formation of a general conceptual basis for the functioning of microbial communities of soils of low-mountain landscapes. © 2022 by the authors.

Due to a large range of climates and soils, and a long-lasting postglacial vegetation history, the Romanian forests are highly diverse and species-rich ecosystems. Approximately 150 natural types of forest ecosystems have been described. Seven zonal forest formations were distinguished: (1) forest steppes and dry oak forests; (2) forests with Oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis); (3) forests with oaks (Quercus spp.) and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus); (4) beech forests: Fagus sylvatica and Fagus sylvatica mixed forests; (5) beech-fir (Abies alba)-spruce (Picea abies) mixed mountain forests; (6) spruce forests; (7) subalpine shrubland with dwarf pine (Pinus mugo subsp. mugo). On extreme sites, azonal forests occur, dominated by (8) black pine (Pinus nigra subsp. banatica); (9) Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris); (10) Carpathian larch (Larix decidua subsp. carpatica) and stone pine (Pinus cembra); (11) valuable broadleaf species, including maple (Acer spp.), ash (Fraxinus spp.), elm (Ulmus spp.), linden (Tilia spec). Along water courses with periodical inundations, riparian forests and shrublands occur, dominated by (12) black alder (Alnus glutinosa); (13) grey alder (A. incana); (14) tamarisk (Myricaria germanica) pioneer copse; (15) pioneer forest with poplar (Populus spp.) and willow (Salix spp.); (16) riparian hardwood forest with oak, elm (Ulmus spp.), ash (Fraxinus spp.). In the EU countries virgin (primeval) and old growth forests account for less than 3% of the total forest area. Most alarming is the situation of temperate virgin and old-growth forest. About 80% of them are situated in the Carpathians, mainly formed by beech, fir, and spruce. Estimations of virgin and quasi-virgin, old-growth forests in Romania range between 150,000 and 200,000 ha. Between 2001 and 2019 about 350,000 ha disappeared through illegal and legal logging. Legislation in Romania demands that production forests have to be managed sustainably, and virgin forests have to be protected. Romanian forests are also subject to European law, such as the Habitats and Birds Directives. However, there is a severe lack of enforcement at all administration levels, even in National Parks. Sanctioning activities by the EU authorities are hardly visible. It follows: (1) It must be in the interest of all of Europe to preserve and protect the last large areas of primeval forest in Europe. (2) The community of EU countries, the Parliament and the European Commission must provide clear guidelines and care for their implementation, connected with attractive, secure and long-term funding programs (compensation for non-use). (3) At a regional level, new creative ideas and concrete initiatives must integrate wilderness areas into regional value creation concepts. © 2022, Tuexenia.

Preserving the TOL is urgent, but has not been included in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Protected areas (PAs) are fundamental for biological conservation. However, we know little about the effectiveness of existing PAs in preserving the TOL of plants and how to prioritize PA expansion for better TOL preservation under future climate and land-cover changes. Here, using high-resolution distribution maps of 8732 woody species in China and phylogeny-based Zonation, we find that current PAs perform poorly in preserving the TOL both at present and in 2070s. The geographical coverage of TOL branches by current PAs is approx. 9%, and less than 3% of the identified priority areas for preserving the TOL are currently protected. Interestingly, the geographical coverage of TOL branches by PAs will be improved from 9% to 52-79% by the identified priority areas for PA expansion. Human pressures in the identified priority areas are high, leading to high cost for future PA expansion. We thus suggest that besides nature reserves and national parks, other effective area-based conservation measures should be considered. Our study argues for the inclusion of preserving the TOL in the post-2020 conservation framework, and provides references for decision-makers to preserve the Earth's evolutionary history.  © 2022 The Authors.","conservation priority; effectiveness; phylogenetic spatial prioritization; post-2020 framework; protected areas; tree of life","China; Geography; Humans; China; decision making; geographical region; land cover; national park; nature reserve; phylogenetics; prioritization; protected area; woody plant; zonation; China; geography; human","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143568168"

Plants were recorded on 273 plots along four straight transects. The composition of the plant species and their environmental correlates were detected using unconstrained correspondence analysis (DCA) with post-hoc correlation of axes against site variables. We tested the effect of site variables on species composition using maximally selected rank statistics, which allow the simultaneous identification of a threshold and assessment of its significance. Species turnover within the vascular plant community along the altitudinal gradient was assessed using the same method on the basis of the DCA sample scores. Using geostatistical models of local temperature and Bayesian methods with binomial errors that account for spatial structure, we tested the influence of temperature on selected single vascular plant species and assessed the suitability of the species as climate change indicators. Temperature was the most important factor explaining the variability in vascular plant community composition, which changed discretely along the altitudinal gradient, with a climate-sensitive zone found between 1,100 and 1,200 m a.s.l. The distribution of ten species with their lower or upper altitudinal limit in this zone was significantly driven by temperature. To track vegetation responses to climate change effectively, we suggest a three-level monitoring program, flexible with regard to the volume of required sampling effort. © 2010 Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.","Ecological thresholds; Global warming; Indicator species; Montane forests; Spatial generalized linear models; Vegetation","Bavaria; Bavarian Forest National Park; Germany; Tracheophyta; air temperature; altitudinal zonation; Bayesian analysis; bioindicator; climate change; climate effect; detection method; geostatistics; global warming; identification method; montane forest; plant community; sensitivity analysis; species diversity; vascular plant","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77952240684"

The unprotected cliffs are retreating rapidly at a long-term average of ~0.35 m year−1, primarily through intermittent local mass failures of varying dimensions. The Chalk is composed of several formations with different physical and mechanical properties that impact on both the character of the failures and the resulting cliff profiles. The rate of cliff retreat varies along the cliffs and appears to have changed over decadal and much longer timescales. The cliff-foot beaches are composed of a combination of grey flints derived directly from erosion of the Chalk and browner flints, excavated from the Chalk long ago and subsequently incorporated into later deposits from which they have been re-excavated. Erosion of the cliffs and platforms is insufficient to maintain the beaches and they are dwindling in volume. The shore platforms slope seaward at angles between 1° and 4° and display a seaward zonation in micro-topography. They are being lowered at an average rate of ~0.4 mm year−1 by a combination of chemical and mechanical, marine and sub-aerial processes, and through bioerosion. In addition, they undergo layer stripping through step erosion and block detachment. The coastline is protected from future development by incorporation in the South Downs National Park, but faces threats from updrift development affecting littoral drift, and potential increased storminess and rising sea levels due to climate change and continuing isostatic adjustment. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Beaches; Chalk; Cliffs; Coastal erosion; Mass failure; Shore platforms","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085318236"

The aim of this study was to characterise the vegetation on ultramafic edaphic ‘islands’ in relation to soil chemistry and elevation. Methods: In total 87 non-permanent vegetation plots were established covering 12 ultramafic edaphic ‘islands’ from 474 to 2950 m asl in which 2854 plant species in 742 genera and 188 families were recorded from 14 662 collections. Results: The results show that plant diversity decreases with elevation, but a mid-elevation (circum 1500 m asl) ‘hump’ occurs for some plant groups (orchids, pteridophytes) as a result of the presence of cloud forests. Six main vegetation classes with associated soil types were discerned: (i) Sub-Alpine Scrub; and (ii) Graminoid Scrub, both associated with Hypermagnesic Cambisols (‘hypermagnesian soils’); (iii) Montane Cloud Forest, associated with Cambisols often with accumulation of humus; (iv) Mixed Dipterocarp Forest, associated with deep Ferralsols (‘laterites’); (v) Pioneer Casuarina Scrub; (vi) Mature Mixed Casuarina Forest, both associated with Hypermagnesic Leptosols. Conclusions: We hypothesised that ‘adverse’ soil chemistry would exacerbate vegetation stunting, and the results confirmed that stunted vegetation and elevational floristic compression occurs on chemically adverse soils (mainly hypermagnesian soils). However, no clear correlation with plant diversity was found, as some of the most ‘adverse’ soils on the summit of Mount Tambuyukon had up to 132 species per 250 m2. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Edaphic factor; Floristic zonation; Serpentinite; Vegetation physiognomy","East Malaysia; Kinabalu National Park; Malaysia; Sabah; Casuarina; Orchidaceae; Pteridophyta; Cambisol; cloud forest; elevation; Ferralsol; island; phytogeographical region; plant community; pteridophyte; scrub; serpentinite; soil chemistry; species diversity; species richness; ultramafic rock","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960399823"

We focus on the understudied altitudinal range between 1500 and 3500 m using micrometeorological data associated with a permanent tree plot network designed to study cloud forest biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics. Data from this plot network were supplemented with data in the public domain across a 20 000 km2 area with time series at individual sites lasting from 2 to 17 yr. Observed diurnal and seasonal trends in microclimate variables were explained by diurnal and seasonal variation in solar radiation and atmospheric moisture flux. Altitudinal trends in microclimate varied seasonally, with solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and temperature reaching their annual maximum earlier at higher altitudes, likely because of seasonally shifting cloud dynamics. Cloud dynamics were important in determining diurnal, seasonal, and altitudinal trends in several microclimate variables, suggesting that changes to cloud frequency and altitudinal occurrence associated with global climate change could have important impacts on cloud forest ecosystem dynamics, in addition to those of rising temperatures. © Inter-Research 2012.","Altitudinal gradient; Andes; Climate change; Cloud dynamics; Seasonality; Tropical montane cloud forest","Andes; Cuzco [Peru]; Kosnipata Valley; Manu National Park; Peru; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Biodiversity; Climate change; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Solar radiation; Sun; Tropics; Altitudinal gradient; Andes; Cloud dynamics; Seasonality; Tropical montane cloud forest; altitudinal zonation; biodiversity; climate change; cloud cover; cloud forest; diurnal variation; ecosystem dynamics; microclimate; micrometeorology; moisture flux; regional climate; seasonal variation; seasonality; time series; vapor pressure; Forestry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84869766611"

Turritella duplicata was found primarily in the lower intertidal zone, and 90 specimens were gathered and measured. Their geographical positions on the flat were mapped, revealing zonations in population distribution, both parallel and perpendicular to the shore-line. The size distribution of the shells indicates that the population consists exclusively of adults. δ18O sclerochronology performed on three shells shows variations of up to 1.5‰ associated with seasonal changes in water parameters, suggesting longevity of about three years and seasonally controlled growth rates. The absence of juveniles and observed population distribution coupled with the sclerochronological data suggest that reproduction occurs in early spring, and that the population represents three cohorts approximately one year in age and older. Migration to deeper water during other seasons cannot be ruled out. Smaller individuals were preferentially found on the inner tidal flat, and individuals older than two years preferentially colonised the outer tidal flat.

The ability to distinguish ancient and modern mineral deposits that are biologically influenced from those that are purely abiotic in origin will advance our ability to interpret microbial evolution from the ancient rock record on earth and potentially other planets. As a step toward deciphering biotic from abiotic processes, we have combined carbonate mineralogical and geochemical analyses together with community-based microbial genetic analyses in hot spring drainage systems at Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. Previously (Fouke et al. 2000, 2003), we reported the shape and chemistry of carbonate mineral deposits (travertine), which have formed along the hot spring outflow. This travertine exhibits five distinct ecological zonations (termed sedimentary depositional facies) even though most physical and chemical attributes of the spring water change smoothly and continuously over the course of the drainage outflow path. Here, we document an unexpectedly sharp correlation between microbial phylogenetic diversity and travertine facies, which suggests that changes in bacterial community composition are a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions along the spring outflow. These results provide an environmental context for constraining abiotic and biotic theories for the origin of distinct crystalline structures and chemistries formed during hot spring travertine precipitation. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887068242"

In general, all these conflicts described above are based on the cultural construction of wilderness connected with the historical picture of Sumava from the beginning of the nineteenth century. There occur some key duality points that exist in endless debates about wilderness in Sumava NP. showing the power of this cultural construction and its misuses. These dualities could be labeled as wilderness under human control. Cultural construction of wilderness in Sumava NP. is static and it is based on consumerism. A long-term perspective is often missing in the debate about the future of the Sumava wilderness. Patience with natural long-term processes is missing too. We suppose that case of Sumava National Park could serve as an example how important is the knowledge of historical, cultural and social-economic context of wilderness, for solving of existing difficulties and conflicts with wilderness protection. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089641815"

By contrast, digital webcam-based phenological research has only developed in recent years, prompted by the development of cheaper user-friendly digital camera systems and by higher staff costs. Webcam photography provides spectral information in red, green and blue (RGB) wavelengths which mirror the seasonal colour changes in trees during bud burst, leaf unfolding, senescence and leaf fall.Recent publications have mainly used two types of image data analysis to define onset dates of certain phenological stages and to compare species and growing seasons. These methods work well, but require high quality of the webcam images. However, changing light and weather conditions complicate data analysis particularly at increasing camera-to-subject distances. We investigated a series of images providing colour information on different tree species, e.g. . Fagus sylvatica, . Populus tremula, as well as of trees at different altitudes (700-1200. m) in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. Webcam images were analysed by the two previously published methods and compared with results derived from a newly developed Bayesian multiple change point analysis. In particular, transition dates of leaf development were identified in the green, as well as the red, colour channel.The Bayesian analysis described phenological transition dates in spring and autumn and specified the uncertainties of the model fit. By contrast, previously employed methods have shortcomings associated with unrealistic asymptotic assumptions in logistic model fits or inability to cope with noise in data series.The change point analysis at different elevations showed how the Bayesian approach coped with increasingly degraded image quality. A delay in green-up of about 2.5 days per 100. m of altitude was estimated for . Fagus sylvatica in the study area. Autumn phenology at different altitudes did not show clear patterns.The Bayesian model approach allows not only the calculation of phenological change points during the year but also estimates the probability of those changes occurring on a particular day. This method appears to estimate reliably phenological events in the growing season, especially when handling low quality webcam data, either from poor weather conditions or when the subject is at a considerable distance from the camera. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Altitudinal gradient; Bayesian statistics; Digital photography; Multiple change point model; Phenology; Webcam","Bavaria; Bavarian Forest National Park; Germany; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica; Populus tremula; altitudinal zonation; Bayesian analysis; data set; deciduous forest; detection method; digital image; growing season; image analysis; phenology; photography; seasonality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867635949"

The vegetation next to these ice masses had to adapt to great climatic changes, and part of this adaptation resulted in the evolution of new species (HULTEN 1968). During deglaciation, the vegetation migrated back into the previously glaciated areas, but the new species usually experienced more difficulty in colonizing the deglaciated areas due to being adapted to specific environmental conditions. As a result, their present-day distribution is centred on the area in which they evolved, whereas the rest of the flora had been selected and were adapted to survive under a wider range of environmental conditions. One of these areas of speciation lay on the eastern margin of Beringia on the north and northwest flank of the former Cordilleran ice sheets. Kluane Lake lies just within the glaciated zone and is therefore a good place to explore the numbers and presence of the new species. The elevational distribution of vascular plants is described for a NW-SE transect across the Slims River valley from the top of Sheep Mountain to the top of Outpost Mountain, at Kluane Lake, Yukon Territory (61° 01′ N, 138° 24′ W). Ten percent of the taxa are local species endemic to the North Cordillera, regardless of vegetation zone or aspect. Aspect altered the total number of species on a mountain and also the vegetation zonation, but not the percentage of taxa from a given geographic source. An analysis of the known distribution of North Cordilleran species indicates that there are three main centres of speciation, of which the rain-shadow area north of the Wrangell-St. Elias Range is the most important (69 taxa or 72% of the total species). The others are the Brooks Range and north Yukon mountains (13 taxa) and the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska (12 taxa).","","Canada; North America; Outpost Mountain; Sheep Mountain; Yukon Territory; Ovis aries; Tracheophyta; endemic species; plant; population distribution; speciation (biology)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-1842734978"

These represent three different pollen assemblage zones recognized in the record of a single core (LOH25). The three samples sets provide lake-wide pollen assemblages at ca. 2350, ca. 6800, and ca. 10,100 yr BP. These spectra are used to investigate two aspects of pollen accumulation: (1) whether pollen taxa have been differentially deposited in sediments in different parts of the lake basin, and (2) whether the entire assemblage has accumulated to a greater extent in deeper parts of the basin (""pollen focussing""). Percentages of the ten major taxa in the assemblages show remarkable basin-wide consistency within each sample set, suggesting that in this case a single core provides a representative pollen record. Multivariate statistical analyses (discriminant function analysis and analysis of variance) on pollen percentage, concentration, and influx data confirm that sample sets are distinctly different and support zonation of the pollen record from a single core. Minor components of the assemblages (< 1% of the pollen sum), mainly NAP, show great variability within and between sample sets and are therefore not reliable for interpretation of vegetation history. Lack of evidence for differential pollen deposition confirms that qualitative inferences based on major components of the pollen sum are probably reliable despite core location within the lake basin. The data do not display consistent evidence for greater pollen accumulation at deeper water sites implying that pollen focussing has not been a major process. Sedimentation rates are variable across the basin at each level, suggesting that pollen concentration and particularly pollen influx data may be unreliable for interpretation of vegetation history from a single core, without much greater chronologic control. © 1992.","","Canada, British Columbia, Yoho National Park, Lake O'Hara; Holocene; lake sediment; palaeoecology; pollen deposition; pollen focussing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027074021"

We hypothesized that (i) vegetation zonation along roadsides is a function of the different microtopography and substrate types (microhabitats) created by road construction and (ii) plant colonization in these microhabitats is dependant upon the presence of suitable regeneration traits adapted to the specific microhabitats. We identified four distinct microhabitats namely shoulder, side slope, ditch and back slope from the edge of the road to the edge of the forest. We conducted vegetation and soil analyses in these microhabitats along 34 random transects running perpendicular to the road to the edge of forest in a 14 km section of the Trans Canada Highway (TCH) in Terra Nova National Park (TNNP), Newfoundland, Canada. The multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) confirmed that the plant communities of the four roadside microhabitats were significantly different from each other. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that composition of roadside plant communities was related to gradients of soil moisture content, bulk density, organic matter depth and pH. Several indicator plants, determined by indicator species analysis (ISA), were abundant in their respective microhabitats, indicating their affinity to particular sets of environmental conditions. The root-shoot analysis of selected dominant plants across the roadside habitats revealed that plants of a particular microhabitat had similar above and below ground spread and biomass allocation patterns. We found that floristic zonation along roadsides is a function of roadside microtopography, substrate type and environmental gradients created by the road building process. The similarities in above and below ground spread and biomass allocation patterns of dominant plants of respective microhabitats could be used as a basis of interpreting the role of autecological attributes of the species that enable them to establish in specific microhabitats. Several native plants, such as Empetrum nigrum, Juniperus communis, Vaccinium angustifolium, Trifolium repens, and Anaphalis margaritaceae are naturally abundant in side slopes and possess autecological attributes such as low stature, widespread above- and below-ground parts, and drought tolerance. Presence of these desirable properties and their perennial habit make them excellent candidates for roadside revegetation. © 2008.","CCA; Micro-topography; MRPP; Regeneration traits; Roadside restoration","Canada; Newfoundland; Newfoundland and Labrador; North America; Terra Nova National Park; Biological materials; Biomass; pH; Plants (botany); Revegetation; Roadsides; Soil moisture; Anaphalis; Empetrum nigrum; Juniperus; Juniperus communis; Trifolium repens; Vaccinium; Vaccinium angustifolium; Biological materials; Biomass; pH; Revegetation; Roadsides; Soil moisture; canonical analysis; community composition; correspondence analysis; floristics; microhabitat; native species; plant community; revegetation; roadside environment; soil analysis; vegetation cover; zonation; Micro-topography; Regeneration traits; Roadside restoration; Plants (botany)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-39149091024"

Episode I began with plinian dispersal of rhyolitic fallout (Layer A) and contemporaneous emplacement of rhyolitic ignimbrites and associated proximal veneers. The plinian column was sustained throughout most of the interval of ash flow generation, in spite of progressive increases in the proportions of dacitic and andesitic ejecta at the expense of rhyolite. Accordingly, plinian Layer B, which fell in unbroken continuity with purely rhyolitic Layer A, is zoned from >99% to ∼15% rhyolite and accumulated synchronously with emplacement of the correspondingly zoned ash flow sequence in Mageik Creek and the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes (VTTS). Only the andesiterichest flow units that cap the flow sequence lack a widespread fallout equivalent, indicating that ignimbrite emplacement barely outlasted the plinian phase. On near-vent ridges, the passing ash flows left proximal ignimbrite veneers that share the compositional zonation of their valley-filling equivalents but exhibit evidence for turbulent deposition and recurrent scour. Episode II began after a break of a few hours and was dominated by plinian dispersal of dacitic Layers C and D, punctuated by minor proximal intraplinian flows and surges. After another break, dacitic Layers F and G resulted from a third plinian episode (III); intercalated with these proximally are thin intraplinian ignimbrites and several andesite-rich fall/flow layers. Both CD and FG were ejected from an inner vent <400 m wide (nested within that of Episode I), into which the rhyolitic lava dome (Novarupta) was still later extruded. Two finer-grained ash layers settled from composite regional dust clouds: Layer E, which accumulated during the D-F hiatus, includes a contribution from small contemporaneous ash flows; and Layer H settled after the main eruption was over. Both are distinct layers in and near the VTTS, but distally they merge with CD and FG, respectively; they are largely dacitic but include rhyolitic shards that erupted during Episode I and were kept aloft by atmospheric turbulence. Published models yield column heights of 23-26 km for A, 22-25 km for CD, and 17-23 km for FG; and peak mass eruption rates of 0.7-1x108, 0.6-2x108, and 0.2-0.4x108 kg s-1, respectively. Fallout volumes, adjusted to reflect calculated redistribution of rhyolitic glass shards, are 8.8 km3, 4.8 km3, and 3.4 km3 for Episodes I, II, and III. Microprobe analyses of glass show that as much as 0.4 km3 of rhyolitic glass shards from eruptive Episode I fell with CDE and 1.1 km3 with FGH. Most of the rhyolitic ash in the dacitic fallout layers fell far downwind (SE of the vent); near the rhyolite-dominated ignimbrite, however, nearly all of Layers E and H are dacitic, showing that the downwind rhyolitic ash is of 'co-plinian' rather than co-ignimbrite origin. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.","","USA, Alaska, Katmai National Park, Novarupta Volcano; ash; fallout; ignimbrite; plinian eruption; rhyolite; volcanic eruption 1912","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027070142"

It contains sheets, lamellae, cylindroidal masses, and ocelli of syenite that show systematic distribution within the monzonite. Lamellae occur in the contact rocks, cylinders are confined to the lower central zone, and sheets are concentrated in the upper central zone. Ocelli are found only in a narrow zone near the top of the sill. All rocks of the sill display similar mineral assemblages with strong compositional zonation of individual mineral species. In particular, feldspars range from intermediate plagioclase, through anorthoclase, to Na-rich sanidine, and finally, to albite plus K-feldspar. Pyroxenes show a general trend from essentially normal augite to increasingly iron-plus-sodium-enriched varieties. Over-all crystal settling did not cause formation of syenitic rocks, but the central zone of the sill contains a relatively mafic monzonite that is complementary in composition and amount to the enclosed bodies of syenite. Border zones have little syenite (1 percent), and the monzonite composition is the same as a mixture of the more mafic central monzonite and enclosed syenitic rocks in the proportions in which they occur in the central zone. Crystal fractionation played a dominant role in generating syenitic rest liquids that could be aggregated into the structures found in the sill; rifting of a partially solid crystal mesh explains the formation of lamellae and many sheets, but the cylindroidal masses and ocelli are more enigmatic. The rocks of the Rattlesnake Mountain sill, as well as others of Big Bend, show distinct chemical similarities to alkalic oceanic suites such as those of the Azores. The syenite of the sill is typical of the undersaturated felsic rocks found in many shallow mafic intrusions in Big Bend, and it is in contrast to oversaturated quartz-bearing microsyenite, microgranite, and extrusive equivalents that occur as separate masses unconnected with more mafic rocks. There appear to be two differentiation trends related, perhaps, to undersaturated and saturated basaltic lava flows known in the area and possibly also affected by depth at which differentiation occurred. © 1975 Geological Society of America.","","Big Bend National Park; Texas; United States; Feldspar; Landforms; Quartz deposits; Zeolites; Basaltic lava flow; Big Bend National Park; Chemical similarity; Compositional zonation; Crystal fractionation; Mafic intrusion; Mineral assemblage; Rattlesnake mountains; basalt; feldspar; igneous intrusion; lava flow; monzonite; petrology; plagioclase; sill; syenite; Rocks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84875032429"

Sodic patches are ecologically important for nutrient accumulation, predator evasion and wallowing, but they are often perceived as derelict lands because of vegetation denudation and low aesthetic quality. This negative perception, by both ecologists and tourists, often leads to ill-advised management and 'rehabilitation' measures. In Kruger National Park, sodic patches occur at the riparian-upland boundary and hence the processes originating in both systems may contribute to their origin. The upland-based catena and riparian-based evapotranspiration models were used to explore the hypothesis that these soils originate from both catena and evapotranspiration-driven hydraulic processes. The models predict vegetation zonation dictated by a salt tolerance gradient and an increase in sodic patch area over time as a result of progressive salt accumulation. Vegetation structure and hillslope morphology across the riparian-upland boundary and analysis of change in patch configuration over a 50-year aerial photographic record were used to test the hypotheses. Sodic patches have unique vegetation, occur on the intermediate positions of hillslopes, have increased in area three-fold over 50 years and are encroaching into the riparian zone. This behaviour is consistent with the assertion that these patches originate from both catena and evapotranspiration processes. Results imply a dynamic aspect of sodic patches, which have been previously viewed as static landscape features in pedogenic time scales. However, we show that they change over relatively smaller time scales meaning that their management should be commensurate with this dynamic nature. Therefore, sodic patches should be managed under a scheme that incorporates their small-scale expansion and recognizes their ecological importance. © 2005 African Journal of Ecology.","Boundary; Catena; Evapotranspiration; Hillslope; River","Africa; Eastern Hemisphere; Kruger National Park; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; World; Catena; Riparia; catena; evapotranspiration; hillslope; pedogenesis; riparian vegetation; sodic soil","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-14844293535"

Mount Mazama consisted of a glaciated complex of overlapping shields and stratovolcanoes, each of which was probably active for a comparatively short interval. All the Mazama magmas apparently evolved within thermally and compositionally zoned crustal magma reservoirs, which reached their maximum volume and degree of differentiation in the climactic magma chamber ∼ 7000 yr B.P. The history displayed in the caldera walls begins with construction of the andesitic Phantom Cone ∼ 400,000 yr B.P. Subsequently, at least 6 major centers erupted combinations of mafic andesite, andesite, or dacite before initiation of the Wisconsin Glaciation ∼ 75,000 yr B.P. Eruption of andesitic and dacitic lavas from 5 or more discrete centers, as well as an episode of dacitic pyroclastic activity, occurred until ∼ 50,000 yr B.P.; by that time, intermediate lava had been erupted at several short-lived vents. Concurrently, and probably during much of the Pleistocene, basaltic to mafic andesitic monogenetic vents built cinder cones and erupted local lava flows low on the flanks of Mount Mazama. Basaltic magma from one of these vents, Forgotten Crater, intercepted the margin of the zoned intermediate to silicic magmatic system and caused eruption of commingled andesitic and dacitic lava along a radial trend sometime between ∼ 22,000 and ∼ 30,000 yr B.P. Dacitic deposits between 22,000 and 50,000 yr old appear to record emplacement of domes high on the south slope. A line of silicic domes that may be between 22,000 and 30,000 yr old, northeast of and radial to the caldera, and a single dome on the north wall were probably fed by the same developing magma chamber as the dacitic lavas of the Forgotten Crater complex. The dacitic Palisade flow on the northeast wall is ∼ 25,000 yr old. These relatively silicic lavas commonly contain traces of hornblende and record early stages in the development of the climatic magma chamber. Some 15,000 to 40,000 yr were apparently needed for development of the climactic magma chamber, which had begun to leak rhyodacitic magma by 7015 ± 45 yr B.P. Four rhyodacitic lava flows and associated tephras were emplaced from an arcuate array of vents north of the summit of Mount Mazama, during a period of ∼ 200 yr before the climactic eruption. The climactic eruption began 6845 ± 50 yr B.P. with voluminous airfall deposition from a high column, perhaps because ejection of ∼ 4-12 km3 of magma to form the lava flows and tephras depressurized the top of the system to the point where vesiculation at depth could sustain a Plinian column. Ejecta of this phase issued from a single vent north of the main Mazama edifice but within the area in which the caldera later formed. The Wineglass Welded Tuff of Williams (1942) is the proximal featheredge of thicker ash-flow deposits downslope to the north, northeast, and east of Mount Mazama and was deposited during the single-vent phase, after collapse of the high column, by ash flows that followed topographic depressions. Approximately 30 km3 of rhyodacitic magma were expelled before collapse of the roof of the magma chamber and inception of caldera formation ended the single-vent phase. Ash flows of the ensuing ring-vent phase erupted from multiple vents as the caldera collapsed. These ash flows surmounted virtually all topographic barriers, caused significant erosion, and produced voluminous deposits zoned from rhyodacite to mafic andesite. The entire climactic eruption and caldera formation were over before the youngest rhyodacitic lava flow had cooled completely, because all the climactic deposits are cut by fumaroles that originated within the underlying lava, and part of the flow oozed down the caldera wall. A total of ∼ 51-59 km3 of magma was ejected in the precursory and climactic eruptions, and ∼ 40-52 km3 of Mount Mazama was lost by caldera formation. The spectacular compositional zonation shown by the climactic ejecta - rhyodacite followed by subordinate andesite and mafic andesite - reflects partial emptying of a zoned system, halted when the crystal-rich magma became too viscous for explosive fragmentation. This zonation was probably brought about by convective separation of low-density, evolved magma from underlying mafic magma. Confinement of postclimactic eruptive activity to the caldera attests to continuing existence of the Mazama magmatic system. © 1983.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021084509"

A tree inventory of the lowland areas of the Park was conducted as part of an ecological study of primates. Two hectares of forest were inventoried within the limits of a 500 hectare study site. There were 1569 trees with diameter at breast height ≥ 10 cm in the sample (minimum of 229 species in 45 families). The tree species Eperua leucantha and Hevea cf. brasiliensis dominated the forest accounting for 29% of the sampled trees. Three forest types were represented: chavascal, terra firme and caatinga. Caatinga was the least diverse forest (H′ = 0.9), and terra firme the most diverse (H′=1.5). Low diversity in caatinga was associated with high species dominance by Eperua leucantha, Micrandra sprucei and Hevea cf. brasiliensis which together accounted for 66% of all sampled trees in one caatinga plot. Compared to Amazonian forests elsewhere, the ranking order of plant families in Pico da Neblina was peculiar in that Leguminosae sensu latu and Euphorbiaceae dominated the sample accounting for 52% of all marked trees. Such families were represented by few tree species, all of which were characterized by dry, large-seeded sclerocarpic fruits. The consequent low availability of fleshy fruits in the forest is suggested as a possible contributing factor to the observed low abundance and diversity of primates in the lowlands of Pico da Neblina.","Amazonia; Brazil; Caatinga; Diversity; Pico da Neblina; Tropical forest; Tropical trees","Brazil; Eperua; Euphorbia; Euphorbiaceae; Fabaceae; Hevea brasiliensis; Micrandra; Primates; floristics; primate; species diversity; species inventory; tropical forest","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036077295"

This controversy was a major factor in the 1972 change of government which rejected lake raising and also appointed Guardians, from among the campaign leaders, to advise on lake management. Lake management guidelines were devised from geomorphological and ecological studies correlated with a 37-year lake level record. High, Main and Low Operating Ranges were recognised within the natural variation (Te Anau 3.5 m; Manapouri 4.8 m). High Operating Range defines both maximum duration at a particular level and minimum periods of subsequent lowering to satisfy ecological requirements of shoreline forest. Low Operating Range defines both draw-down rates (to prevent slumping of fine beach sediments) and maximum annual duration at particular levels (to prevent combing down and possible loss over narrow shelves, of beach sediments). Main Operating Ranges have negligible restrictions. The guidelines were verified in practice and incorporated in legislation in 1981. Monitoring of shoreline vegetation and beaches has confirmed achievement of objectives. Wide consultation, aimed at further conflict resolution and replacement of empowering legislation by consents under the 1991 Resource Management Act, was completed, with guidelines and monitoring incorporated, in 1996. We believe the scientifically based management guidelines have effectively integrated nature conservation with hydro-electric development in Fiordland National park, a World Heritage Area since 1986.

Four mineral associations can be differentiated within the vertical succession of the profiles in the Etosha Pan: I) analcime/K-feldspar and mica association; II) analcime/K-feldspar and sepiolite (loughlinite) association; III) expandable sheet silicate (saponite/stevensite) association; and IV) calcite and dolomite association. These mineral associations are the expression of the seasonal saline-alkaline to calciferous, saline-alkaline environment of the present Etosha Pan. The sedimentological and pedological descriptions, combined with the results of the mineralogical and chemical analyses, show a clear differentiation of the profiles of the Etosha Pan in: i) disintegrated sedimentary rocks of the Andoni Formation (mineral association I); ii) par-autochthonous sediments (mineral associations I and II); and iii) allochthonous sediments (mineral associations III and IV). Based on this vertical mineralogical differentiation, four sedimentological-mineralogical/chemical zones are defined for the actual floor of the Etosha Pan. The zonation shows that a thin cover of allochthonous sediments is only present along the southern margin of the Etosha Pan, including Fisher's Pan. The results support the hypothesis that the Etosha Pan is an erosional form rather than a palaeolake. In principle, the zonal configuration of the recent allochthonous and parautochthonous sediments identified on the Etosha Pan provides a small-scale depositional environment model for the formation of the Etosha limestone and sediments of the Andoni Formation during the Oligocene and Miocene. Thus, the findings help to reconstruct the depositional environment of the evolution of the extensive depocentre of the Etosha basin during the Late Tertiary.","","Namibia, Etosha Pan; clay mineralogy; depositional environment; geochemistry; mineralogy; saline lake; seasonal lake; seasonal variation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029754636"

Structurally, this area can be subdivided into four units: (1) the easternmost part of the basement along the Galana river is characterized by subhorizontal slightly to the west and east dipping foliation planes. Migmatic paragneisses with intercalated marbles, calcsilicates and metapelites and bands of amphibolites are the dominant rock type. (2) The western part of the Galana river within the Tsavo East National Park is a ca. 25 km wide shear zone with subvertical foliation planes. The eastern part shows similar rocks as observed in unit 1, while towards west, metasedimentary units become rare and the main rock types are tonalitic gneisses with intercalated amphibolites. (3) A 10 km wide zone (Sagala Hills zone) between the strike slip zone (unit 2) and the Taita Hills (unit 4) is developed. This zone is characterized by elongated and folded felsic migmatic amphibole and garnet bearing orthogneiss bodies with intercalated bands of mafic rocks. (4) The Taita Hills are a slightly to the N dipping nappe stack. The main rock type in the Taita Hills are amphibole-biotite-plagioclase- quartz ± garnet ± clinopyroxene ± scapolite bearing migmatic gneisses with mafic bands. In the southern part, metapelites, marbles and some amphibolites are common. Although the geological structures are different in units 1 and 2, the calculated PT conditions are similar with peak PT of 760-820°C and 7.5-9.5 kbar. Temperatures in unit 3 (Sagalla Hills zone) and unit 4 (Taita Hills) are slightly higher ca. 760-840°C, but pressure is significantly higher, ranging from 10 to 12 kbar. Sillimanite growth around kyanite, garnet zonation pattern, mineral reaction textures, and PT calculations constrain a ""clock-wise"" PT-path with near isobaric cooling following the peak of metamorphism. The different PT conditions, tectonic setting, and a different age of metamorphism are evidence that units 1 and 2 (Galana river) belong to a different tectono-metamorphic event than unit 3 (Sagala Hills zone) and 4 (Taita Hills). The major shear zone (unit 2) marks a tectonic suture dividing the two different tectono-metamorphic domains. It is also likely that it played an important role during exhumation of the granulite facies rocks from units 3 and 4. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Granulite; Kenya; Mozambique belt; Pan-African; Petrography; PT-path","Africa; Eastern Hemisphere; Mozambique Belt; Sub-Saharan Africa; World; geobarometry; granulite; Pan African orogeny","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-23844494129"

Cutting of reeds in late summer as a means of controlling reed encroachment was investigated under three different inundation regimes, termed 'wet zone' (permanently inundated), 'moist zone' (infrequently inundated) and 'dry zone' (rarely inundated). The effects of a single annual cut were furthermore compared to those of two successive annual cuts. Without cutting, wet zones had thinner and shorter, but more abundant reeds than drier zones. Cutting in dry and moist zones resulted after one year in more, but shorter and thinner reeds, whereas in wet zones reeds were almost eliminated. After two years, reeds in wet zones had not recovered from the first annual cut. In moist and dry zones, a second annual cut did not result in amplified detrimental effects on reeds. Throughout the experiment, moisture zone was the factor with the largest effect, cutting had the second largest impact, and inter-annual variation was relatively unimportant. We have demonstrated that cutting alone has minimal long-term effect on above-ground reed biomass, whereas reed growth and survivorship can be strongly suppressed through cutting in late-summer in conjunction with inundation with moderately saline water (5.0-7.5 g kg -1). Cut reeds must remain completely inundated for at least a four-week period, or else emerging shoots should be re-cut below the water level. Cut material should be removed from the treatment site. Whenever possible, cutting and inundation should be undertaken to coincide with periods when salinity levels of surface waters are higher. It is foreseen that reed management in the Wilderness Lakes would have positive effects on other biota by countering progression towards single species domination of wetland plant communities and reinstating exposed sandbanks which are extensively utilised by resident and migratory waterbirds. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aquatic plant management; Biodiversity conservation; Cutting; Encroachment; Flooding; Local eradication; Non-tidal; Saline","Africa; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Western Cape; Wilderness National Park; Phragmites australis; aquatic plant; biodiversity; estuarine environment; flooding; nature conservation; reedbed; survivorship; weed control; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-51449114532"

In 1997 a major initiative was undertaken by the Government of Indonesia to decentralize management efforts from central to local levels for several national marine parks, including Bunaken National Park in the northern region of the country. This initiative marked a major milestone in the process of democratic reform. In this article, the evolution of Bunaken National Park community involvement in marine resource management prior to the period of democratic reform until the present is described. In the current and still evolving management strategy, community involvement occurs in a collaborative manner with input from government and non-government stakeholders. This research highlights the centerpiece of collaborative efforts, the participatory zonation process and product, and the differing roles of community and scientific information in the zonation construction process. Community-based information, for example, provides local perspectives on the use of shared coastal resources, while scientific information provides insight into the health status of resources within shallow water areas. In September 2004, the Bunaken Park Management Advisory Board (MAB) acknowledged the need to integrate greater scientific information into its management strategy for marine resource evaluation and monitoring purposes. This presents a unique opportunity to examine how satellite imagery, which may be used to identify the spatial location of specific coastal features and detect their change through time, can be linked with local community participation for the purpose of managing human activities within a marine resources environment. Thus, this article contributes to ongoing research linking geospatial technologies with local community participation. Conclusions move beyond suggestions regarding the importance and value of incorporating community knowledge with remote sensing technology, identifying prominent issues for consideration. These are presented as a series of steps.","Community participation; Indonesia; Management; Remote sensing","Asia; Bunaken National Marine Park; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Indonesia; North Sulawesi; Southeast Asia; World; community resource management; marine park; marine resource; remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-23044486285"

Location: The study was carried out in two nearby semi-arid protected areas of the Ispahan province: the Kolah-Ghazi National Park (c. 50,000 ha; 1540-2535 m a.s.l.) and the Mouteh Wildlife Refuge (c. 220,000 ha; 1493-2900 m a.s.l.). Annual average precipitation and temperature range from 155-205 mm and 15-19.5°C, respectively. Vegetation cover is sparse. Methods: The two study areas were sampled with a 1 × 1 km grid design. A subset of 405 squares was randomly chosen and each was visited once during spring or summer by a team of five observers walking from one side of a square to the other and back, recording the birds encountered. Raptors and species considered to be accidental or migrating were not taken into account. We first looked for avifaunal, vegetation, and geomorphological gradients using Correspondence Analysis. As we found spatial autocorrelation within our response variables (avifaunal richness, abundance and/or composition), we first calculated an autocorrelation term, then added this autocorrelation term in anova, ancova (separate slope design) and stepwise regression to assess the relative role of spatial autocorrelation and environmental explanatory variables (vegetation, altitude, climate, or topography). We also partitioned the variance of the avifaunal matrix between several sets of co-variables, after controlling for spatial effects, using a series of partial Canonical Correspondence Analyses. Results: A main gradient, common to the two areas, distinguishes bird species characteristic of flat sedimentary areas and species dwelling in mountainous and/or rocky areas. Despite the generally low values of the correlations measured, we found that richness, abundance and composition of the avifauna were better correlated with topography, especially the altitudinal amplitude within each square, than any other variable, including vegetation. Altitudinal amplitude is related to substrate complexity. Main conclusions: In arid zones of central Iran, topographic features seem to be the main factors structuring avifaunal composition and abundance. Avifaunal composition and richness are mainly correlated with the complexity of the substrate, but both avifaunal richness and abundance increase with altitude, probably in response to decreasing aridity. We did not observe any bird altitudinal zonation in a strict sense. These results contrast with those generally observed in mid-latitude regions of the Palaearctic. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Avifaunal community; Birds; Climate; Compositional gradient; Iran; Species abundance; Species richness; Sub-desert areas; Topography; vegetation","Asia; Eurasia; Iran; Middle East; Aves; Raptores; abundance; avifauna; community composition; species richness; topography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33645225750"

Four ecological zones were delimited: a dry forest zone, a moist montane zone, a tropical alpine zone, and a montaine rainforest zone. The tropical alpine zone is partly, and the montaine rainforest zone wholly, located within the Park; human impact there must now be minimized in order to meet Park objectives of preserving natural vegetation. This is feasible given that nobody in Pataz depends completely on one particular ecological zone for food or livelihood.

The granitoid units that make up the sequence are progressively younger and more felsic inward. The bulk of the rocks are granodiorite, but the outermost formation is quartz diorite, and the innermost one is granite porphyry. The compositional gradient changes both gradually within formations and abruptly between them. The change is greatest in the outer 1 km and lower toward the center of the sequence. Hornblende and biotite, abundant in the marginal rocks, decrease rapidly inward for 1 km as K-feldspar and quartz increase, but farther inward, they decrease slowly. The most conspicuous chemical changes are shown by the elements that are enriched in the mafic minerals. The compositional zoning indicates that with decreasing temperature, the sequence solidified from the margins inward. Solidification was interrupted repeatedly by surges of fluid core magma. The magma eroded the adjacent solidifying rock, and it expanded the area of the magma chamber at the exposed level by crowding the wall and roof rocks outward and upward and by breaking through the solidifying carapace into the wall rocks. The compositional zonation resulted from crystal fractionation that could have involved (1) preferential accretion of crystalline material present in the magma to the margins of the magma chamber, thus displacing the melt phase progressively inward, and/or (2) downward settling of crystals, probably accompanied by upward movement of melt and volatiles; the residual magma solidifying to form the granitoids. Although either mechanism can explain the observed relations, they lead to very different interpretations of the composition of the magma when the first exposed granitoids solidified at the margins of the magma chamber and as the sequence solidified inward. © 1979 Geological Society of America.","","California; United States; Yosemite National Park; Crystalline materials; Feldspar; Forestry; Mica; Quartz; Solidification; Zoning; Chemical change; Compositional gradients; Compositional zonation; Compositional zoning; Crystal fractionation; Sierra Nevada batholith; Upward movement; Yosemite National Park; batholith; crystallization; fractionation; granitoid; granodiorite; magma chamber; pluton; solidification; Rocks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0001606919"

The pattern of deposition changes markedly from time to time, and the vegetation is thus a mosaic of recovery phases in different stages of development. There is marked zonation of layers of gravel, silt and organic matter in the soil profile, running sequentially from the mouth of the river back to the moor. Furthermore, there is a decrease in the depth of the water table with distance from the river mouth. The growth increment of Malus Toringo is poor under the canopy of Ulmus Davidiana var. japonica forest, with maximum growth occurring in the areas of active alluvial deposition. The changing patterns of Malus growth have been used to approximate the dates of major changes in the erosion channels and areas of alluvial deposition. There were five main channels in the study area. The oldest was on the west side and active ca. 35-40 yr prior to 1984, the year of sampling. Subsequently, adjacent areas further east became major drainage and erosion channels about 25-30 yr before 1984. However, after 1985 the erosion channels again showed a marked change in pattern, and currently flow into an entirely different sector, being responsible for the continuous dynamic patterns of vegetational change in this area. © 1991 Ecological Society of Japan.","Alluvial deposition; Annual ring analysis; Erosion channels; Malus Toringo; Senjogahara moor","Japan, Honshu, Nikko National Park, Sakasagawa River; Betula platyphylla japonica; Malus toringo; Ulmus davidiana japonica; alluvial deposition; disturbance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026382276"

The lacustrine vegetation comprises three distinct forms: floating plants, benthic hydrophytes and helophytes, which are described and classified from the phytosociological point of view, as follows: (a) the vegetation of the floating plants belong to the Lemnetea class and is represented by two plant communities; (b) the vegetation of the benthic hydrophytes, belongs to the Potametea class consisting of two different categories, namely the submersed formations and the emergent formations of the hydrophytes. Various plant communities were recognised in this type of vegetation and three among them are considered as the most representative; (c) the vegetation of helophytes, the prevailing life form in this wetland, belongs to the Phragmitetea class and is represented mainly by seven well organised plant communities. The respective vegetation of two of the five more important wetland sites is described. The terrestrial vegetation is composed of forest and meadow vegetation. The forest vegetation of the National Park belongs to the class Querco-Fagetea and shows the following zonation: (a) in the vicinity of the lake, at the elevation of 860-1000 m, two associations have been found: the mixed deciduous and evergreen forests of Ostryo-Carpinion orientalis and the evergreen forests of Ostryo-Carpinion adriaticum; (b) the deciduous oak forests surround the previous zone at the altitude of 900-1300 m with two principal associations, namely the Quercetum frainetto and the Quercetum petraeae; (c) in the upper forest layer between 1200-1800 m asl, dominate beech forests of the association Fagion moesiacum and the less extensive occurrence of the mixed beech-fir stands (Ass. Abieti-Fagetum moesiacum). The zone above the tree limit is distinguished by its subalpine character semi-shrub vegetation extending higher than the forest ( 1800-2000 m), whereas alpine meadows cover the vegetation at higher altitudes. On the plains and in the forest clearings exist herbaceous meadow formations of variable structure, in parallel with the vegetation of specific habitats, such as nitrophilous and ammophilous plants. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Aquatic vegetation; Greece; Phytosociology; Plant biodiversity; Terrestrial vegetation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085780499"

The Finnish Forest and Park Service (Metsähallitus) was given the mandate to expand the current protected areas in southern Finland by 10 000 ha. The question is which areas should be selected out of the total area of 1 760 000 ha. The data available include a nation-wide GIS data set describing general features of forests at the resolution of 25 m × 25 m for entire Finland and another data set about biodiversity features within the current state-managed conservation areas. Ecologically, the key information includes forest age and the volume of growing stock for 20 forest types representing different productivity classes and dominant tree species. Our analysis employs four different connectivity components to identify forest areas that are (i) locally of high quality and internally well connected, (ii) well connected to surrounding high-quality forests, (iii) well connected to existing conservation areas, and (iv) large enough to allow efficient implementation. Expert evaluation of the results suggested that the present quantitative analysis was helpful in identifying areas with high conservation value systematically across southern Finland. Our analysis also showed that the highest forest conservation potential in Finland is located on privately owned land.

The aim of the trip was to explore the possibilities of establishing a research project on the distribution and ecology of epiphytic angiosperm plants in the primary forests surrounding Mount Kinabalu. Topo-climatic studies on the hygrothermal altitudinal zonation of Mount Kinabalu should be included in the project. Because the lowland rain forest of the foothills of Mount Kinabalu have to a large degree been degraded and converted to agricultural lands, three well-preserved forest reserves (Sepilok near Sandakan, Danum Valley near Lahad Datu and the Crocker Range near Kota Kinabalu) were selected in order to gain some insight into the Dipterocarpaceae-dominated lowland rain forests of Borneo. Additionally, certain islands off the western and eastern coasts of Sabah (Tungku Abdul Rahman National Park and Turtle Island respectively) were visited in order to assess the possibilities of comparing the epiphyte vegetation of the mainland forests with that of the outlying islands. Observations concerning the altitudinal zonation of the vegetation and measurements of the soil temperature allowed an integration of the vegetational zones into the hygrothermal altitudinal zonation of the Kinabalu Mountain massive. In contrast to montane forests, the low-land forests on the Sabah mainland are relatively poor in epiphytes. A possible reason could be the regular occurrence of ENSO events which in South-East Asia have been identified as one of the causes of changes in the flowering phenology of forest trees and even for the immense species richness of the Mount Kinabalu.","","Asia; East Malaysia; Eurasia; Malaysia; Mount Kinabalu; Sabah; Southeast Asia; Dipterocarpaceae; Magnoliophyta; Testudines; angiosperm; biodiversity; climate change; epiphyte; rainforest; vegetation; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33846834058"

Therefore we must propose a new mode of classifying the territories submitted to environmental protection: the fundamental distinction is between parks (multiple use regions, with human enjoyment, active elements in the planning of the countryside, dynamic centres of cultural and economic activities) and reserves (areas drastically excluded from land use for purely scientific ends). While recognizing the administrative and bureaucratic difficulties that such a conception is bound to meet with, we insist on the necessity of sustaining this thesis as the only valid one for solving the impending local and general problems. The purposes of the park are conservation, recreation, multicisciplinary research, didactics, and experimentation, all understood from the naturalistic and anthropic points of view. The juridical and economic aspects that such a conception leads to are examined as well. As regards structures, some concepts, such as that of 'bounderies', are considered as well as certain general criteria in the light of dynamic and evolving norms. Finally, a very rough scheme of functional zonation is attempted, mainly to summarize what has been set out. © 1978.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-50849154115"

It was established in 2003 in order to protect Lake Ag-Gel and the surrounding semi-desert landscape. To date, detailed information on local people's livelihoods was not available. Against the background of modern protected area management the present paper analyses the socio-economic situation, and in particular the land use and resulting conflicts in the vicinity of Ag-Gel National Park. The analysis is base d on Rapid Rural Appraisal techniques and focused on semi-structured interviews with the sedentary population of the study area. The situation of the population and the agricultural sector in the study area has been subject to the following three processes: the political and economical transformation, the resulting agrarian reform and the consequences of conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. Over 90% of the sedentary population are internally displaced persons (IDPs) of the territorial conflict. The majority of people earns a living from subsis tence farming, especially livestock husbandry. Grazing, especially overgrazing within the national park was identified as the main land use conflict. In orde r to accommodate the different land use interests, a zonation concept for the national park as well as the creation of a buffer zone outside the park are suggested. To prevent further impoverishment of the affected population, compensation of incurred losses and alternative methods of earning income become necessary. A range of measures is discussed.","Ag-Gel National Park; Azerbaijan; Internally displaced persons (IDPs); Land use; Overgrazing; Socio-economic situation; Zonation","Ag-Gel National Park; Asia; Azerbaijan; Eurasia; West Asia; conflict management; land use; national park; nature conservation; overgrazing; socioeconomic conditions; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-29144484034"

Although the scheme proceeded, the lake levels were not raised as originally proposed. Rather, government sought guidelines to optimize hydroelectric potential while maintaining ecological stability of the vulnerable, largely forested, glaciated lakeshores. Guidelines were derived by relating the vegetation zonation to the natural lake-level fluctuations recorded daily for 37 years. A high operating range in the upper third of the lakes' natural ranges, based on flood tolerances of the woody shoreline species, restricts both duration and frequency. A low operating range (ca. lower third) safeguards stability of shoreline sediments by limiting drawn-down rates, duration, and frequency. The main operating range (ca. middle third) has few limitations. These guidelines, which allow utilization of ca. 93% of the water resource, have now been verified by instances of flooding and draw-down rates that exceeded the natural rates recorded earlier. The guidelines were officially accepted by the government in 1977 as a basis for managing the valuable multiple resources of these two lakes and their environs, and they were formalized in legislation in 1981. The details and merits of the guideline approach are discussed. © 1985 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.","Applied ecology; Conservation; Fiordland; Hydroelectricity; Lake levels; Lake Manapouri; Lake shore vegetation; Lake Te Anau; National Park; New Zealand","lake water; ecology; geographic distribution; new zealand; nonhuman; water management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021967019"

Initial investigations confirmed that the mangrove species demonstrate zonations parallel to the shoreline and are dominated by the family Rhizophoraceae with Avicennia, Heritiera and Sonneratia also important constituents of the mangroves. We investigated the vertical distributions of pollen assemblages at three sites. Partial CCA analysis demonstrated that at all three sites, elevation was a significant control on the distribution of pollen assemblages in surface samples. We combined the three contemporary transects to develop a regional transfer function to explain the relationship between the surface assemblages and elevations using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. The developed transfer function indicated mangrove pollen can be used as a precise indicator of past sea levels with an error of ± 0.22 m. The transfer function was applied to two fossil cores from the Wakatobi Marine National Park and evaluated using the Modern Analogue Technique. Both cores showed similar patterns in changes of palaeo mangrove elevation and had modern analogues in the contemporary training set.

The plateau coincides with a negative gravity anomaly interpreted as a large silicic magma reservoir. About 0.15 km3 of rhyodacitic pyroclastic flows were erupted 1100 years ago from vents beneath the present Crags and flowed for 21 km down the valleys of Lost and Manzanita Creeks. Pumice pyroclasts in the flows are characterized by high phenocryst content and low vesicularity. These eruptions were followed by the extrusion of 1.25 km3 of dacitic lava as a stubby flow and three-lobed dome. The tephra and lava appear to be products of intrusion of mostly liquid high-alumina basalt into a large, partially crystallized rhyolitic magma body with subsequent mixing.

This change with time reflects either a vertical zonation in the magma inherited from the mixing event or a continued admixing of basaltic magma within the chamber during the span of eruptive period. © 1980.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0018922115"

Location: Biebrza National Park, NE Poland. Methods: We carried out a two-season reciprocal transplantation experiment: sod-blocks were replaced between a low-productive groundwater-fed small-sedge fen and a high-productive fluviogenous tall-sedge fen. Five treatments were applied to the transplanted sods: (1) no manipulation; (2) fertilization with NPK to exclude the effect of nutrient limitation; (3) clipping vegetation around the transplant to exclude competition for light; (4) clipping + fertilizing; (5) sods were also transplanted within their own environment. Results: After two seasons, the small-sedge sods transplanted into the high-productive zone had a biomass two times lower than that of the control transplants, mainly due to a decrease in small sedges and bryophytes. Tall sedges of the high-productive zone did not respond significantly to transplantation in the low-productive zone. Removal of the surrounding vegetation largely enhanced the growth of small sedges and bryophytes and, to a lesser degree, of tall sedges. Fertilization, on the other hand, resulted in increased growth of tall sedges, grasses and non-graminoid herbs. Conclusion: Species characteristic of low-productive fen communities are competitively excluded from the high-productive zone through light competition. In contrast, the performance of tall sedges in the low-productive zone is lowered by nutrient limitation. In the long run this may lead to a complete disappearance of these species from this zone. We did not find evidence that the physical stress of flooding has a direct effect on the performance and distribution of species. Results from the experiment suggest that productivity gradients and their influence on competition intensity are of primary importance for structuring vegetation patterns in lowland riparian fens. © IAVS; Opulus Press.","Biebrza; Biomass; Gradient; Light availability; Productivity; Sedge; Shoot:Root Ratio; Vegetation removal","Bryophyta; bryophytes; Carex; Poaceae","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33846845028"

However, the lack of zoning is common for most protected areas in developing countries and, as a consequence, many protected areas are not effective in achieving the goals for which they were created. In this work, we introduce a quantitative method to expeditiously zone protected areas and we evaluate its ecological implications on hypothetical zoning cases. A real-world application is reported for the Talampaya National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Argentina. Our method is a modification of the zoning forest model developed by Bos [Bos, J., 1993. Zoning in forest management: a quadratic assignment problem solved by simulated annealing. Journal of Environmental Management 37, 127-145.]. Main innovations involve a quadratic function of distance between land units, non-reciprocal weights for adjacent land uses (mathematically represented by a non-symmetric matrix), and the possibility of imposing a connectivity constraint. Due to its intrinsic spatial dimension, the zoning problem belongs to the NP-hard class, i.e. a solution can only be obtained in non-polynomial time [Nemhausser, G., Wolsey, L., 1988. Integer and Combinatorial Optimization. John Wiley, New York.]. For that purpose, we applied a simulated annealing heuristic implemented as a FORTRAN language routine. Our innovations were effective in achieving zoning designs more compatible with biological diversity protection. The quadratic distance term facilitated the delineation of core zones for elements of significance; the connectivity constraint minimized fragmentation; non-reciprocal land use weightings contributed to better representing management decisions, and influenced mainly the edge and shape of zones. This quantitative method can assist the zoning process within protected areas by offering many zonation scheme alternatives with minimum cost, time and effort. This ability provides a new tool to improve zoning within protected areas in developing countries. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These fiddler crabs exhibit distinct intertidal distributions that may affect air and water oxygen extraction rates. Uca vocans and U. tetragonon occupy low intertidal zones that experience long submersion times, whereas U. crassipes inhabits high intertidal habitats having long emersion periods. Respective aerial oxygen consumption rates were 0.312, 0.300, and 0.193 mg/l at 26.0°C, and 0.600, 0.554, and 0.357 mg/l at 32.1°C.

Temperature quotients (Q10) for all crabs were approximately 2 in air; however, U. vocans and U. tetragonon increased Q10 to approximately 3 when moved to water, whereas U. crassipes Q10 values remained essentially unchanged. High oxygen extraction rates and Q10 responses in aerial environments may allow U. vocans and U. tetragonon to repay oxygen debt quickly during short emersion periods. Because U. crassipes spends most of its time emerged, it is less dependent on anaerobic respiration, and may not need to rapidly pay back oxygen debt. © 2005 Koninklijke Brill NV.","","Asia; Eurasia; Greater Sunda Islands; Hoga; Indonesia; Kaledupa; Malay Archipelago; Southeast Asia; Southeast Sulawesi; Sulawesi; Sunda Isles; Tukangbesi Islands; Wakatobi Marine National Park; Decapoda (Crustacea); Ocypodidae; Thalassuca vocans; Uca; Uca tetragonon; crab; emersion; intertidal environment; oxygen; physiological response; respiration; temperature gradient; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33947405331"

Various bioclimatic types (sensu EMBERGER and DAGET) are thus represented in this area: semi-arid, subhumid, humid and locally superhumid (annual rainfall > 1200 mm), with hot, temperate and cool variants. Taking into account this bioclimatic approach, with emphasis of ombrothermic criteria (T, m and P), three vegetation belts (sensu RIVAS-MARTINEZ) are distinguished: the thermo-, the meso- and the supramediterranean belt. The mesomediterranean belt, domain of the sclerophyllous oaks Quercus rotundifolia and Quercus suber, is well-represented, with three horizons (superior, middle, inferior). Owing of a slight altitude of this mountain (1629 m), the montane-mediterranean belt, corresponding to the cold variant (m < 3 °C), does not appear. So, the Atlas cedar-community is entirely located at the supramediterranean belt (in National Park of Chréa). The syntaxonomical interpretation of forest and pre-forest vegetation shows that it belongs to three classes (Quercetea ilicis and Quercetea pubescentis, essentially), four orders (Quercetalia ilicis, Pistacio-Rhamnetalia alaterni, Querco-Cedretalia atlanticae and Prunetalia spinosae) and eight alliances. The sclerophyllous oaks communities, mainly, take place into three forest alliances (Querco-Oleion sylvestris, Quercion suberis, Balansaeo-Quercion rotundifoliae) and also in the preforest order Pistacio-Rhamnetalia (with two alliances Ericion arboreae, Tetraclini-Pistacion atlanticae). The 16 syntaxa, actually recognized on the Blidean Atlas, presented in a synthetic table, are finally related to a dynamic framework of eight vegetation series (half of them spreads in the mesomediterranean belt), following altitudinal zonation of vegetation defined in this chorologic territory: serie of Aleppo Pine and Berberian Thuya, serie of Oleo-lentisque in the mesomediterranean belt; Quercus suber serie, Quercus rotundifolia serie, serie of Green Oak and Aleppo Pine, residual serie of Quercus canariensis in the mesomediterranean belt; Cedrus atlantica serie, edaphic serie of Acer obtusatum in the supramediterranean belt.","Blidean Atlas; Forest and pre-forest communities; Ombrothermic criteria; Syntaxonomy; Vegetation belts; Vegetation series","Algeria; Atlas Mountains; Tell Atlas; Acer; Acer obtusatum; Cedrus; Cedrus atlantica; Cedrus atlantica; Pinus halepensis; Quercus; Quercus canariensis; Quercus rotundifolia; Quercus suber; Quercus suber; Thuja; bioclimatology; plant community; syntaxonomy; vegetation mapping","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036320557"

The lacustrine vegetation comprises three distinct forms: floating plants, benthic hydrophytes and helophytes, which are described and classified from the phytosociological point of view, as follows: (a) the vegetation of the floating plants belong to the Lemnetea class and is represented by two plant communities; (b) the vegetation of the benthic hydrophytes, belongs to the Potametea class consisting of two different categories, namely the submersed formations and the emergent formations of the hydrophytes. Various plant communities were recognised in this type of vegetation and three among them are considered as the most representative; (c) the vegetation of helophytes, the prevailing life form in this wetland, belongs to the Phragmitetea class and is represented mainly by seven well organised plant communities. The respective vegetation of two of the five more important wetland sites is described. The terrestrial vegetation is composed of forest and meadow vegetation. The forest vegetation of the National Park belongs to the class Querco-Fagetea and shows the following zonation: (a) in the vicinity of the lake, at the elevation of 860-1000 m, two associations have been found: the mixed deciduous and evergreen forests of Ostryo-Carpinion orientalis and the evergreen forests of Ostryo-Carpinion adriaticum; (b) the deciduous oak forests surround the previous zone at the altitude of 900-1300 m with two principal associations, namely the Quercetum frainetto and the Quercetum petraeae; (c) in the upper forest layer between 1200-1800 m asl, dominate beech forests of the association Fagion moesiacum and the less extensive occurrence of the mixed beech-fir stands (Ass. Abieti-Fagetum moesiacum). The zone above the tree limit is distinguished by its subalpine character semi-shrub vegetation extending higher than the forest (1800-2000 m), whereas alpine meadows cover the vegetation at higher altitudes. On the plains and in the forest clearings exist herbaceous meadow formations of variable structure, in parallel with the vegetation of specific habitats, such as nitrophilous and ammophilous plants.","Aquatic vegetation; Greece; Phytosociology; Plant biodiversity; Terrestrial vegetation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030856819"

This area is considered to be largely representative of the Southern Kalahari in general. The region is covered by a layer of red sand piled into dunes. Two large dry river-beds cross the area and numerous pans occur. Calcrete outcrops are found along rivercourses and around pans. The vegetation is generally an extremely open shrub or tree savanna and phytogeographically the area is regarded as belonging to the Karoo-Namib Region. 132 quadrats, most of which covered 100 m2, were studied and the vegetation is classified according to the Zürich-Montpellier method. The physiognomy of all phytocoenoses was determined according to the system of Fosberg (1967). A striking correlation was found between plant communities and the four main habitats: sand, calcrete, pans and river-beds. Twelve syntaxa were recognized, eight of these are described as associations and one as a subassociation. They are as follows:- 1. On sand: Stipagrostietum amabilis (with subass. terminalietosum) found on dune crests, Hirpicio echini-Asthenatheretum on more compact red sand in dune valleys, Monechma incanum-Stipagrostis ciliata (two communities) on pink to whitish sand, Peliostomo-Stipagrostietum obtusae on whitish compact sand; 2. On calcrete: Aizoo-Indigoferetum auricomae; 3. On pans and pan-like formations: Sporobolo lampranthi-Zygophylletum tenuis on pan-like alluvial flats in the Nossob rivercourse, Sporoboletum coromandelianion the central parts of pans, Sporoboletum rangei along the periphery of pans and on sand accretions on the pan surface, Lycium tenue community on small loamy sand accretions on pans or in river-beds; 4. In river-beds: Panicetum colorati. Life form spectra based on total cover-abundance values are given. Differences in the spectra of various communities are briefly discussed with reference to their habitats. Therophytes were shown to be the most important life form in all syntaxa except the Sporoboletum rangei. The vegetation exhibits a very marked zonation and a sequential relationship between communities is demonstrated. © 1973 Dr. W. Junk b.v.

Six 25 m x 100 m fixed area plots recorded a total of 2143 woody stems of ≥3 cm d.b.h. from 204 species. The 78 variable-area plots recorded the nearest twenty trees of ≥20 cm d.b.h. to an objectively chosen point, giving a total of 1560 stems in 9.1 ha from 156 species. A linear trend of increasing stem density with altitude was seen for variable-area plots. Species diversity is highest at high elevations. There was no clear zonation of elevational vegetation types. Restricted range taxa occur at all altitudes sampled. The study also revealed some methodological considerations. Bias in sample size and plot area can be tested by employing two sampling methods. Of the two methods used, fixed area plots are preferred as variable area plots are impractical in tangled understorey. Plot size must be controlled for in order to make reliable observations of diversity.

Where the Snowy Range Formation is overlain by the Maywood unit (Devonian), both were measured and sampled, although the Maywood proved to be unfossiliferous. Lowermost of the three members of the Snowy Range is the Dry Creek Shale which lies conformably on the Pilgrim Limestone. It consists of about 50 feet of purplish, thin-bedded, fissile to slightly plastic shale with a few irregular beds of brownish-gray, platy, dolomitic siltstone in the lower three fourths, and some thin beds of silty limestone or limestone-pebble conglomerate in the upper quarter. No evidence is present in this area for subaerial erosion between the Pilgrim and Snowy Range Formations, although beds of siltstone in the Dry Creek may reflect uplift and erosion at the source of terrigenous sediments. The middle member is the Sage, which averages about 200 feet thick where complete. Its base is marked at most localities by a 1-20-foot bioherm of columnar algal limestone; the remainder is a fairly regular alternation of 1-2-foot beds of limestone or limestone-pebble conglomerate with 2-4-foot beds of green shale or very argillaceous greenish-gray limestone. The upper part contains beds of noncolumnar algal limestone. This member was deposited far from shore in shallow turbid water that contained abundant calcium in solution. Microcrystalline calcite ooze, along with fine fragments of fossils and pellets, collected in ripple troughs and other depressions in the mud of the sea floor. These small accumulations became sufficiently consolidated to maintain coherence when excavated by currents that swept away clay particles and concentrated the limestone ""pods"" into beds that later were cemented to form limestone-pebble conglomerate. The uppermost member, the Grove Creek, is nowhere complete in this area; the upper part was removed by erosion at some localities and by faulting at others. The member consists of about 25 feet of dolomitized limestone-pebble or cobble conglomerate with intercalated beds of dolomitized, gray, splintery shale. This member owes much of its distinctive character to weathering that took place before deposition of the Upper Ordovician Bighorn Formation. The Maywood unit is a Devonian soil or weathered zone that overlies some part of the Snowy Range Formation in the northwestern part of the area of study but overlies formations as low as those in the Precambrian Belt Series or as high as the Upper Ordovician Bighorn Formation in other parts of Montana. It consists of a greatly varying thickness (averaging about 55 feet) of reddish-orange or brown, thin-bedded, silty dolomite or dolomitic limestone. At a few localities it is coarse-grained, thick-bedded, light-brown dolomite. No fossils were found in the Maywood of the area studied, but Devonian fossils have been collected from it in other parts of Montana. Fossils described are 80 species assigned to 48 genera of trilobites, 20 species assigned to 14 genera of brachiopods, four species in four genera of gastropods, two species in one genus of conodonts, one species of sponge, one of graptolite, two form species of algal limestone, and problematica. New taxa are the trilobites Comanchia lippa n.sp., Geragnostus ? insolitus n.sp., Monocheilus demissus n.sp., Pinctus ? artus n.sp., P. ? pullus n.sp., Pseudagnostus sentosus n.sp., Rasettia snowyensis n.sp., Saratogia carita n.sp., S. fracida n.sp., and Taenicephalus gallupensis n.sp.; the brachiopods Angulotreta catheta n.sp., A. glabra n.sp., A. vescula n.sp., Eoorthis remnicha var. A. n. var. and Huenella texana var. fortis n.var. Fossil species in the Snowy Range Formation are assigned to local zones that are based on ranges of genera and species of trilobites and which can be correlated with standard zones of the Cambrian Correlation Chart or with local zones of other areas. A few species from scattered localities near the base of the formation belong to the Aphelaspis or Dunderbergia zones of the Dresbachian Stage. Most species belong to zones in the Franconian. Lower-most of these is the Elvinia Zone (with Camaraspis Subzone and Irvingella major Zonule in the upper part) which corresponds to the Elvinia Zone of the Cambrian Correlation Chart. Next higher is the Taenicephalus Zone (with Parabolinoides Subzone at base) which correlates with the Conaspis Zone of the Chart. Above this is the Idahoia Zone (with basal I. wyomingensis Subzone, middle I. wisconsensis Subzone, and upper I. serapio Subzone) which correlates with the Ptychaspis Subzone of the Ptychaspis-Prosaukia Zone of the Chart. The uppermost zone of the Franconian is the Prosaukia Zone, which is equivalent to the Prosaukia Subzone of the Chart. Species of the Trempealeauan Stage are assigned to the Illaenurus Zone which corresponds to the Lower Trempealeauan of Texas or the lower part of the Saukia Zone of the upper Mississippi Valley. An alternative zonation is offered, based on the ranges of genera and species of brachiopods. Boundaries of most brachiopod zones fall near the levels of the boundaries of trilobite zones, but some do not. The Apsotreta expansa Zone belongs to the Dresbachian Stage. The Linnarssonella Zone and the Angulotreta tetonensis Zone (with Ceratreta-Eoorthis Subzone at base) correspond respectively to the Elvinia and Taenicephalus Zones of the lower part of the Franconian Stage. The Angulotreta vescula Zone corresponds to all but the uppermost part of the Idahoia Zone, and the A. catheta Zone (with Finkelnburgia osceola Subzone at top) is equivalent to this uppermost part of the Idahoia Zone and the entire Prosaukia Zone of the Franconian Stage as well as the entire Illaenurus Zone of the Trempealeauan Stage. No Franconian-Trempealeauan boundary is apparent in the brachiopod zonation.","","Montana; Snowy Range; United States; Wyoming; Calcite; Erosion; Lime; Shale; Stratigraphy; Value engineering; Weathering; Clay particles; Coarse-grained; Correlation chart; Dolomitic limestone; Terrigenous sediment; Upper Mississippi; Varying thickness; Yellowstone national parks; biostratigraphy; brachiopod; conglomerate; Devonian; fossil record; gastropod; limestone; new species; siltstone; subduction zone; terrigenous deposit; turbidite; Limestone","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-24944516433"

Little is known about the ecology and diversity of yeasts inhabiting these extreme environments. We studied yeast occurrence (with special emphasis on those producing carotenoid pigments) at five high-altitude (>1400 m a.s.l.) water bodies located in the Nahuel Huapi National Park (Bariloche, Argentina). Isolates were identified using a polyphasic approach. Production of photoprotective compounds (carotenoids and mycosporines) by yeast isolates, and UVB resistance of selected species were studied. All water samples contained viable yeast cells in variable numbers, generally ranging from 49 to 209 cells L-1. A total of 24 yeast species was found; at least four represented novel species. Carotenogenic yeasts prevailed in lakes with low water conductivity and higher transparency and chlorophyll a levels. Apparently, the ability to produce photoprotective compounds in yeasts was related to the transparency of mountain lake waters, and strains from more transparent waters developed increased UVB resistance. Our results indicate that UVR is an important environmental factor affecting the yeast community structure in aquatic habitats. © 2009 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Between 2000 and 3200 m asl twenty-four 0.05 ha forest plots were selected at altitudinal intervals of 100 m, and eight soil profiles were described at intervals of 200 m. A TWINSPAN classification aided in the determination of eight zonal forest communities on the basis of their floristic composition. They are grouped in two sets of four: (i) the palm-rich lauraceous-fagaceous Lower Montane Mollinedia-Quercus Forests (2000-2600 m asl) and (ii) the bamboo-rich myrsinaceous-fagaceous Upper Montane Schefflera-Quercus Forests (2500-3200 m asl), respectively. Vegetation changes seem correlated with two major climatic gradients: (i) a temperature gradient (altitude), and (ii) a moisture gradient (wet Atlantic vs. moist Pacific slope). Most soils are Andepts, and residual, colluvial or derived from volcanic material. Humus layers are thicker on the wetter Atlantic slope. A total of 431 vascular plant species consisted of 86 pteridophytes, 1 gymnosperm, 296 dicots and 48 monocots. Species richness, canopy height and stem diameter decrease with increasing altitude, while the canopy surface becomes more flattend. A comparison with other studies shows that Chirripó's montane Quercus forests fit within the environmental ranges known from altitudinal zonations elsewhere in the Tropics. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Altitudinal gradient; Cloud forest; Edaphic zone; Neotropical montane forest; Oak forest; Talamanca","Costa Rica, Chirripo Massif, Chirripo National Park; Quercus spp.; Mollinedia; Quercus; Schefflera; altitudinal gradient; cloud forest; montane forest; vegetation zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028982652"

Its flora was poorly documented; therefore, 5 recent expeditions between 1998 and 2004 were carried out, which resulted in the collection of 179 species that belong to 51 families. Six major wadis (sites) were investigated to cover adequately the territory of the Park (35,600 km2) and to attain as complete an inventory of its vascular flora as possible. The floristic composition and species diversity among the wadis showed variations in species richness, yet W. Yahameib was the most diversified. The most species-rich families were Compositae (12%), Leguminosae (9%), Gramineae (6.7%), Caryophyllaceae, Convolvulaceae and Euphorbiaceae(4.4% for each). This study revealed that the Gebel Elba Park is more diverse compared with other, well-studied phytogeographic territories in Egypt. Ninety-two species (51.4%) demonstrated a certain degree of consistency, where they were exclusively recorded in or confined to a certain wadi (site) or group of wadis. The life-form spectrum was dominated by therophytes, denoting a typical arid desert flora, while phanerophytes, chamaephytes and hemicryptophytes were of equal importance. The distribution of the phytogeographic elements in the distinguished life-form categories showed the prevalence of the Saharo-Arabian geoelement (48%), whereas the Sudano-Zambezian and Mediterranean geoelements ranked second, with 19.6% and 14 %, respectively. Therefore, the Gebel Elba Park represents a continuation of the Sudanian tropical region, which still needs further intensive study. A very special study undertaken to examine the diversity-altitude relationships along an altitudinal gradient in W. Yahameib revealed that the highest diversity occurred at middle altitudes on the mountain, which may be more typical of arid mountains in desert regions. © TÜBİTAK.","Altitudinal zonation; Arid coastal mountain; Biogeography; Distribution patterns; Egypt; Floristic richness; Multivariate analysis","Africa; Egypt; Gebel Elba National Park; North Africa; Red Sea [(GVR) Egypt]; Asteraceae; Caryophyllaceae; Convolvulaceae; Euphorbia; Euphorbiaceae; Fabaceae; Poaceae; altitudinal zonation; community composition; floristics; multivariate analysis; phytogeography; species diversity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33646269265"

Location: Field work was carried out on the eastern slope of the eastern Cordillera, Colombian Andes, between Tamá Peak to the north, in the Tamá National Park (07°23′ N, 72°23′W) and the San Miguel River (00°28′ N, 77°17′W) to the south. Methods: Sampling was carried out between February 1997 and November 1999 in five regions spanning elevation gradients. In each gradient, six sites were chosen at 250 m intervals between 1000 and 2250 m a.s.l. Results We found a curvilinear relationship between altitude and mean species richness, with a peak in richness at middle elevations. However, the diversity of dung beetle assemblages does not seem to be related to the interregional differences in environmental conditions. The number of geographically restricted species is negatively and significantly related to altitude, with geographically restricted species more frequent at low altitude sites. Ordination delimited the two main groups according to altitude: one with all the highest sites (1750-2250 m a.s.l.) and a second group with the remaining sites (< 1750 m a.s.l.). Analysis of species co-occurrence shows that these dung beetle assemblages seem to be spatially structured when all sites have the same probability of being chosen. In contrast, the spatial structure of species assemblages seems to be random when the probability of choosing any site is proportional to its altitude. Main conclusions: The altitude of sites is the main factor that influences the diversity of these dung beetle assemblages. The peak in species richness at middle elevations, the higher number of geographically restricted species at lower altitudinal levels, and the compositional differences along these mountain gradients seem to result from the mixing at these altitudes of dung beetle assemblages that have different environmental adaptations and, probably, different origins. The relevance of altitude in these assemblages is related to the limited role of these Neotropical high altitude environments as centres of refuge and vicariance for a monophyletic group of warm-adapted species, for which the vertical colonization of these high mountain environments by lineages distributed at lower altitudes would have been very difficult. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Altitudinal distribution; Colombian Andes; Composition; Diversity; Dung beetles; Scarabaeinae; Species co-occurrence","Andes; Colombia; South America; Western Hemisphere; World; Coleoptera; Scarabaeidae; Scarabaeinae; altitudinal zonation; beetle; community composition; rarity; species richness","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-22144464142"

In this study we summarize and compare data on defoliation and discoloration of Norway spruce dominated stands from three regions of the Czech Republic that differ in their lithology. In the Šumava and Krkonoše regions these measures increased over the monitoring period, which is interpreted as an effect of residual soil acidification. At Beskydy, a general stability in forest health parameters was observed. Regional differences are attributed to underlying lithography - the greater calcium carbonate content of the flysch bedrock at Beskydy provides better buffering against acid deposition. These results are supported by evidence of similar trends in atmospheric pollution (ambient air concentrations and deposition) between Beskydy and the Krkonoše region and higher sulphur inputs than at Šumava. Stand elevation and age, collected as explanatory variables, did not affect this interpretation. Additionally, in the Krkonoše region forest health data were examined for four soil type categories (extreme, acidic, enriched and nutritive) specific to forest conditions in the Czech Republic. Simple time series analysis of defoliation and discoloration demonstrated that extreme and acidic soils accounted for the majority of the increasing trend of forest decline in Krkonoše. However, multivariate non-linear regression analysis using elevation and stand age revealed that defoliation was not significantly different between acidic and nutritive soil type categories; rather, this was an artefact of the experimental design. The implications of the research are that acidic and nutritive soil type categories respond similarly to acid deposition while enriched, the most nutrient rich type category is most resistant. As such our results support the interpretation that lithology is a factor mitigating forest decline in Norway spruce dominated forests in the Czech Republic. Our results have implications for zonation strategies like those being used in Krkonoše National Park which seek to prescribe specific restoration measures based upon abiotic factors for acid-damaged forests. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Data were obtained using belt transects across the Holocene coastal dune zone. Vegetation zonation from the seashore to the foredune slacks is analysed in relation to chorological, phytosociological and life-form types. We found that under relatively undisturbed environmental conditions communities formed a sequence (communities 1 to 7), with the exception of a replacement community, which occupied gaps in the perennial vegetation. The spatial distribution of some communities was reduced as a consequence of disturbance; others became fragmented in small patches or even disappeared. In coastal environments with strong, complex gradients, the existence of certain communities depends on specific links (neighbourhood effects) and high connectivity values do not indicate better conservation conditions.","Boundary richness; Coastal plant community; Spatial pattern; Transect","Circeo National Park; Italy; connectivity; disturbance; dune; patchiness; sensitivity analysis; spatial analysis; species richness","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034143569"

The strong environmental gradient sampled, entirely within Peru's Manu National Park and Biosphere Reserve, supports highly diverse faunas. Elevational distributions of 901 bird species, 129 bat species, and twenty-eight species of native mice exhibit contrasting patterns in species richness, species composition, and species turnover. Birds and bats showed smooth declines of species richness with elevation, whereas the richness of mouse assemblages was unrelated to elevation. For all three groups, the greatest differences were between lowland and highland faunas, although cutoff points for this contrast varied among groups (≃500 m for birds, 750 m for bats, and 1000 m for mice). Differences in composition also separated bird and bat faunas on either side of c. 1400 m (the boundary between montane forest and cloud forest); for mice, this faunal transition may take place nearer to 2000 m. Bird and bat faunas lacked the more discrete zonations suggested for mouse assemblages, as indicated by elevational range profiles and nested subset analyses. Distinct highland assemblages are apparent in two-dimensional histograms of range limits of birds and mice, but not for bats. Highland bat species occupy broader elevational ranges than lowland bat species, but for both birds and mice, species at intermediate elevations had the broadest amplitudes. Finally, clumping of range maxima and minima along the gradient identified zones of pronounced species turnover in each group, but these were generally not strongly associated with the locations of ecotones. Differences in zonation of these groups appear to reflect their different biological attributes and phylogenetic histories. Such differences obviously complicate discussions of 'general' diversity patterns, and limit the usefulness of birds to forecast or predict diversity patterns in other more poorly known groups other groups may show elevated diversity and endemism in areas where avian diversity patterns appear unremarkable. The pronounced contrasts between bats and mice, and the generally intermediate character of avian patterns, suggest that future analyses might profitably partition birds into finer, more homogeneous groups of historically and/or ecologically similar species. Group differences in zonation may ultimately prove explicable with information on both species-abundance patterns and resource distributions.","Diversity; Elevational gradient; Faunal similarity; Species richness; Survey and inventory; Taxonomic patterns","Andes; Manu National Park; Peru; avifauna; elevation; environmental gradient; mammal; zonation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031723297"

Restoration of wildland fire to forests is a challenge when historical fire regimes have been altered. We studied four fires that burned over approximately 7865 ha on an altitudinal gradient in Grand Canyon National Park, USA, in 2003. The fires met criteria for the current USA policy allowing the restoration of fire's ecological role in forest landscapes: Wildland Fire Use for Resource Benefits. 2. After the fires burned out, we remeasured 82 permanent pre-established monitoring plots burned by the fires plus 43 additional plots on unburned companion sites. 3. The maximum height of charring of tree boles and basal area mortality increased in mean value and variability with altitude. At a low-altitude Pinus-Quercus site, tree density declined significantly but basal area was unchanged. At a mid-altitude mixed-conifer site and a high-altitude Picea/Abies/Populus site, both density and basal area declined. 4. The thinning effect of fire was concentrated on smaller, shorter, fire-susceptible trees. Small-diameter trees (< 20 cm diameter) made up 79-95% of all tree mortality. Shade-tolerant conifers, particularly true firs and spruce, experienced disproportionate mortality (31-82% basal area decline), while fire-resistant ponderosa pine and Douglas fir tended to survive (2-8% basal area decline). Delayed mortality between the first and second years following the fires accounted for only 4.2% of trees dying at the low-altitude site but 15.6% and 11.2% at the mid- and high-altitude sites, respectively. Regeneration density was highly variable but forest floor and woody debris declined in burned areas. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that, even after an unusually long fire-free period (1880-2003), at the mid- and high-altitude burned sites fire effects were consistent with restoration of historical patterns, moving the ecosystems closer to historical reference conditions. Fires simultaneously reduced the living, dead and ladder fuels that made the forest vulnerable to uncharacteristically severe fire. These effects make the forests more resistant to the expected increases in fire size and severity under future climate conditions. Even at longer-than-historical fire intervals, the wildland fire use policy can benefit Grand Canyon forests. © 2006 The Authors.","Aspen; Douglas fir; Fuels; Gambel oak; Kaibab Plateau; Ponderosa pine; Spruce; White fir; Wildland fire use","Arizona; Grand Canyon National Park; North America; United States; Abies grandis; Coniferophyta; Picea; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Quercus; Quercus gambelii; altitudinal zonation; coniferous tree; deciduous tree; fuelwood; habitat restoration; mortality; regeneration; vulnerability; wildfire","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33845976658"
