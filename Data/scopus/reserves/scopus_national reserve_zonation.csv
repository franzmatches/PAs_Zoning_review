Published spatial prioritization exercises often focus on well-studied groups, with data compiled from on-line databases of ad-hoc collections. Conservation plans generally aim to protect all components of biodiversity, and it is implied that the species used in prioritization act as surrogates. Here, we assess the sensitivity of spatial priorities to model and surrogate choice using a case study from a fragmented agricultural area of south eastern Australia that is poorly represented in the national reserve system. We model the distributions of 30 species of bird, microbat and bee using two types of SDM; generalised linear models based on systematic surveys that yield presence and absence observations, and MaxEnt models based on biodiversity database records. Eight prioritization scenarios were tested using Zonation software, and were based on either the presence-background or presence-absence SDMs and combinations of surrogacy among the three taxa. We found low correlations between SDMs generated for the same species using different modelling frameworks (μ = 0.18, n = 26). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) estimates generated by MaxEnt were optimistic; on average 1.36 times higher than when tested against the systematic survey data. Conservation priorities were sensitive to the choice of surrogate and type of data used to fit SDMs, and though bats and birds formed moderately good surrogates for each other, there was less compelling evidence of surrogacy for bees. Because valid surrogacy is unlikely with most existing data sets, investment in high quality data for less-surveyed groups prior to planning should still be a priority. If this is not possible, then it is advisable to analyse the sensitivity of conservation plans to the assumed surrogacy and quality of data available.

The study was performed during 2003-2004 in Los Alerces National Reserve, Argentina. The huemul fresh signs were intensively sought and registered on transects distributed at random as evidence of habitat use. The transects were laid perpendicular to the contour lines, running continuously from low to high elevations. The sampling points were placed on each contour line to evaluate the availability of the vegetation types. We used a nonmapping technique and the Bonferroni confidence intervals to analyze the habitat selection on a seasonal basis. The huemul signs were found at elevations that varied significantly across the seasons. The seasonal distribution of the signs showed that during autumn and winter, the huemul selected the lenga (Nothofagus pumilio) forests and high shrublands, respectively, and the high-Andean vegetation in summer. The observed pattern of habitat selection reflects the movements from the high elevations in summer to the low elevations in winter. This pattern appeared to be influenced by food availability. The protection of the habitat, ranging from the low valleys to the mountain-top areas, and the actions to reduce human pressure in the low elevations appear critical for the conservation of the huemul populations.","Altitudinal movements; Argentina; Habitat selection; Hippocamelus bisulcus; Nothofagus forests; Patagonia","Andes; Argentina; Chubut; Los Alerces National Park; Patagonia; altitudinal zonation; contour map; endangered species; food availability; habitat conservation; habitat selection; habitat use; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation type","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84887651668"
