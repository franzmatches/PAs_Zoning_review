The giant sand massif Naryn of 30 thousand km area betweenVolgaund Ural rivers is practically not studied. The massifis considered as per respective because of presence of fresh groundwater lenses of considerable scale, development of continuous large ridges and barchan-type massifs. Eolians and shaverelative good filtrating surfaces and and capacities, favorable conditions for infiltration of surface runoff, drainage and displacement of primarily saline waters. Underground waters here are desalinated for the full capacity of water-bearing sands. For the region of sand massifs placement was conducted the analyses of space images was carried out to delineate the boundaries of sandy massifs and to identify promising aquifer zones. Taking into account, that the remote sensing allows to receive an information indicating the presence of groundwater, space monitoring of factors related to relief and soil cover has been performed.The boundaries of the change in the parameters of the relief-landscape features of the study area are determined and the map of lineaments was constructed. Decoding of space images allowed to carry out the field reconnaissance work in the territorymore purposefully. Route hydrogeological studies have made it possible to assess the current state of surface and groundwaters, soils and vegetation of the research area. Hydrogeological zoning and assessment of natural reserves and groundwater resources, predicted exploitation resources of fresh and slightly saline groundwater with calculation of their modules were carried out. A map of hydrogeological zonation on the thickness and mineralization of groundwater in eoliansediments was prepared for assessing of groundwater resources and a final map of groundwater resources of the Naryn Sands was constructed. © SGEM2017.","Assessment of natural reserves; Hydrological conditions; Map of groundwater resources; Naryn Sand massifs; Remote sensing data","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063102706"

Our aim in this paper is to analyse the results, based on each of these tools, using Marxan, a mapping software to obtain a zonation of a protect area in Mediterranean central Italy . The management algorithms of protected areas are widely used to identify potential networks of natural reserves that meet pre-established ecological limits, such as the presence of a specific percentage of habitats or a specific number of populations, at the same time minimizing costs. The Marxan software was made for different habitat where fragmentation of natural patches are significantly lower than in the study area, but it show interesting and useful result also in this situation. Marxan is particularly useful to solve the problem of the minimum set, in which the aim is to identify, at the lowest possible cost, the areas in which the biodiversity preconditions identified are present. In this work the Circeo National Park (Central Italy) was analysed, as an example of the Mediterranean area. We elaborated, through Marxan a series of maps of the priority areas for conservation that can be used as a starting point working with all the stakeholders involved in the management of the area itself. The main information suggests is to take particular attention to seasonal variations in the composition of the bird communities and, consequently, to the weight that the Park assumes at national and international level in the context of migratory movements and biodiversity conservation. In addition, special attention must be paid to the growing of intensive, rapidly expanding agricultural activities that are not enough controlled and are potentially highly damaging for the Park's biodiversity, both in terms of vegetation and fauna. © 2019 Centro Italiano Studi Ornitologici.

Therefore, landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) mapping is necessary for government agencies and decision makers to select suitable locations for giant pandas. The main purpose of this study is to produce landside susceptibility maps using logistic regression (LR), analytical hierarchy process (AHP), and a combined fuzzy and support vector machine (F-SVM) hybrid method based on geographic information systems (GIS). A total of 1773 landslide scarps larger than one cell (25 × 25 m2) were selected in the landslide inventory mapping, 70 % of which were selected at random to be used as test data, and the other 30 % were used as validation. Topographical, geological, and hydrographical data were collected, processed, and constructed into a spatial database. Nine conditioning factors were chosen as influencing factors related to landslide occurrence: slope degree, aspect, altitude, profile curvature, geology and lithology, distance from faults, distance from rivers, distance from roads, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Landslide susceptible areas were analyzed and mapped using the landslide occurrence factors by different methods. For conventional assessment, weights and rates of the affecting factors were assigned based on experience and knowledge of experts. In order to reduce the subjectivity, a combined fuzzy and SVM hybrid model was generated for LSZ in this paper. In this approach, the rates of each thematic layer were generated by the fuzzy similarity method, and weights were created by the SVM method. To confirm the practicality of the susceptibility map produced by this improved method, a comparison study with LR, AHP was assessed by means of their validation. The outcome indicated that the combined fuzzy and SVM method (accuracy is 85.73 %) is better than AHP (accuracy is 78.84 %), whereas it is relatively similar to LR (accuracy is 84.55 %). The susceptibility map based on combined the fuzzy and SVM approach also shows that 5.8 % of the study area is assigned as very highly susceptible areas, and 17.8 % of the study area is assigned as highly susceptible areas. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Combined fuzzy and SVM; GIS; Landslide susceptibility map; Wolong Giant Panda Natural Reserve","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940520570"

In 2018, the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, established a roadmap for biodiversity conservation, which includes the operationalization of GI covering 30% of the territory by 2030. In this paper, we demonstrate a GI mapping framework in the canton of Geneva. Our approach is based on the combined assessment of three 'pillars', namely species' distribution, landscape structure and connectivity, and ecosystem services, to optimize the allocation of conservation actions using the spatial prioritization software, Zonation. The identified priority conservation areas closely overlap existing natural reserves. Including the three pillars in the landscape prioritization should also improve adhesion to the GI idea, without undermining the protection of threatened species. With regards to land use planning, public and private land parcels with high values for GI may require specific incentives to maintain their desirable characteristics, as they are more likely to be degraded than areas with more building restrictions. Visualizing priority conservation areas in a spatially explicit manner will support decision-makers in Geneva to optimally allocate limited resources for ecosystem preservation. © 2020 by the authors.","Biodiversity strategy; Environmental policy; Geneva; Spatial conservation prioritization; Switzerland; Systematic conservation planning; Zonation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081560775"

Many researches have found that plant (especially C3plants) δ13C increased with altitudes. Discrimination of photosynthesis to 13C, which is a key process for causing the difference of 13C content between plants and atmosphere, is influenced by environment, but it achieves through biological processes finally. So analysis of relationships between plant δ13C and eco-physiological parameters (photosynthesis, diffusion, nutrient content, morphology etc.) is more meaningful and helpful to interpret the relationship between plant δ13C and altitudinal gradients than those between plant δ13C and environmental factors. Foliar traits on carbon isotope ratio, photosynthesis, diffusional conductance to CO2, nutrient content and morphology of Quercus spinosa in three sites with different altitudes from Wolong reserve were measured in order to understand and interpret how foliar δ13C of Quercus spinosa responses to altitudinal gradients in this area. The relationships among foliar δ13C and altitudinal gradients and eco- physiological parameters were analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis firstly. Some of them that correlated significantly with each other were analyzed again by Standardised Major Axis (SMA). Foliar δ13C of Quercus spinosa increased with altitude (R2=0. 56, P<0. 001), and the altitudinal difference of δ13C amount to 2. 0‰per 1000m. Theoretically, when mesophyll conductance (gm) is considered as a limited factor for CO2diffusion, there should be a more significant correlation between δ13C and the ratio of chloroplast partial pressure of CO2to ambient CO2partial pressure (Pc/ Pa) than that between δ13C and the ratio of intercellular to ambient partial pressure of CO2(Pi/ Pa). So Pc/ Pashould be better used for indicating δ13C instead of Pi/ Pa. We found that lower Pc/ Paat higher altitude caused by decreasing diffusional conductance (stomatal conductance (gs) and gm) was main reason why foliar δ13C of Quercus spinosa increased with altitudes and gs(R2=0. 71, P <0. 001) was a more important factor to foliar δ13C than gm(R2=0. 65, P =0. 003). Meanwhile, leaf mass per area (LMA) that increased with altitudes also had a positive effect on this trend (R2=0. 35, P =0. 017). Nitrogen content per leaf area (Narea) increased with altitudes, but more nitrogen was allocated to non-photosynthetic system that caused the drop of carboxylation efficiency and photosynthetic rate at high altitudes, and then played a negative role on the changes of foliar δ13C with altitudes in a certain extent. Additionally, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) was testified to be a better indicator for the relationship between leaf nitrogen content and foliar CO2fixing, also for foliar δ13C than Nareaand nitrogen content per leaf mass (Nmass).","Altitudinal response; Leaf carbon isotope discrimination; Quercus spinosa; Wolong Natural Reserve","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960873160"

In this study, we investigated agerelated responses of juvenile and mature subalpine fir trees (Abies faxoniana Rehder & E.H. Wilson.) growing at altitudes between 2,500 and 3,500 m in the Wanglang Natural Reserve in southwest China, to study the adaptive strategies of different age trees to suit changing environments. We found that there were distinct age- and altituderelated changes in the structural and biochemical characteristics of leaves. At all altitudes, mature trees exhibited higher area- and mass-based leaf nitrogen content (Narea, Nmass), leaf mass per area (LMA) and stable isotope carbon composition (δ13C), and a lower chlorophyll (Chl) content than those juvenile trees, except for Nmass at 3,000 m as well as LMA at 2,750 m, where the values of Nmass and LMA in mature trees were slightly lower than those in juvenile trees. Furthermore, leaf characteristics showed significant differences in the change rates with altitude between different age groups. Our results indicated that assimilative organs in mature trees do not suffering from nutrient deficiency and that juvenile and mature trees possess different adaptive growth strategies under changing environments, as indicated by higher leaf N content in mature trees and the opposite patterns of LMA and Chl content between two age groups. We also concluded that juvenile could be more sensitive to global warming due to a greater altitudinal influence on the leaf traits in juvenile trees than those in mature trees.","Altitudinal gradient; Chlorophyll; Leaf mass per area; Nitrogen content; Wateruse efficiency","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84864775836"

In this work, we modelled the geographic distribution of reptiles in the Tandilia Mountains to: a) explore the environmental factors affecting the distribution of reptiles on the highland grasslands of the Tandilia Mountain System and (b) identify the key biodiversity areas. We used ten environmental variables and several sources of records (fieldwork, scientific literature, museum collections, and an online database) to model the distribution of each reptile species.

Through random sampling and multivariate analysis we recognised five dune habitats from the upper beach to a pine forest. We then analysed plant cover and richness of specific ecological guilds (typical, ruderal and alien species) along the coastal dune vegetation zonation. The two habitats closer to the seashore (upper beach and embryo dunes) and the Mediterranean maquis show the highest cover and richness of typical plant species, while the dune grasslands harbour the high total number of species. The pine forest, although artificially planted, retains its psammophilous character thanks to the occurrence of many dune species. We should also note that two important coastal dune habitats were not found in the study area: shifting dune communities with Ammophila arenaria and the semi-stabilized dunes with Crucianella maritima. Overall, in this contribution we highlight the presence of residual natural coastal dune habitats of high conservation value together with a widespread agricultural and artificial landscape matrix.","Campania region; Habitats Directive; Psammophilous species; Random sampling; Sele river","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040715695"

In particular, alpine biomes are sensitive to a variety of environmental changes. Therefore, understanding the distribution and conservation of alpine plant biodiversity is vital. In this study, we used species distribution modeling and 20,650 high-resolution occurrence coordinates of 1224 plant species to evaluate the potential distribution of plants in the northeastern Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (Qinghai Province, China) under different future climate scenarios, through an integrative analysis of species distribution probabilities, species richness, and priority conservation areas. Under current and future climate scenarios, the plant species are predicted to be mainly distributed in eastern and southern Qinghai Province, with the suitable conditions for plant species gradually extending from the southeast to the northwest of Qinghai Province under the effects of climate change. The priority conservation areas in Qinghai national nature reserves are predicted to expand, with this expansion being greater for herbaceous plants than woody plants, under future climate scenarios. However, the priority conservation areas outside nature reserves in Qinghai Province remain approximately three times larger than those inside nature reserves. Thus, there were great differences between the existing nature reserve area and the priority conservation areas, with nature reserves insufficiently covering priority conservation areas in Qinghai Province.

On basis of measurement of the four patch types [gap phase (G), building phase (B), mature phase (M) and degenerate phase (D)], the distribution pattern of different patch types and heterogeneity of the light and temperature along an altitudinal gradient were analyzed. The study forests were located in Larix chinensis forests in the Taibai Natural Reserve, and the whole forest was divided into three transects, i.e. low altitude (2900-3000 m a.s.l.), middle altitude (3100-3200 m a.s.l.) and high altitude (3300-3400 m a.s.l.). The implications of environmental heterogeneity on species coexistence and maintenance of species diversity were discussed in this paper. Our results were as follows: (1) In different elevation gradient, the proportions of the four patch types were different. Compared with low elevation and high elevation, in middle elevation, the proportions of gap phase and building phase were obviously lower; while the proportions of mature phase and degenerate phase were noticeably higher. In different elevation gradient, the distribution pattern of the four patch types was changed to some extent. (2) The daily change patterns of light and temperature in different patch types in forest cycle were different. The light intensity was much greater in gap phase than in the other three phases. The light intensity and its amplitude of changes in different patch types followed the order of G>D>B≥M. Air temperature in different patch types followed the order of G>B>D≥M. The amplitude of diurnal temperature changes in air and soil surface followed the order of G>D>B>M. (3) With elevation increasing, light intensity, the biggest air temperature, biggest soil temperature and temperature difference in four patch phase increased significantly, and average air temperature and average soil temperature significantly decreased. The spatio-temporal heterogeneity of ecological factors in different patch types in forest cycle provided a basis to maintain the coexistence of different species with different characteristics within forest community.","Coexistence; Ecological factors; Forest growth cycle; Patch type","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896701048"

Those interactions have strong impacts on local salinity conditions and availability of water and nutrients at local level, and on mangrove structure and composition. Based on the analysis of aerial photographs, field sampling and statistical multivariate analysis, floristic composition and structure of the mangroves present in the Sanguaré Natural Reserve were analyzed. Three types of forests were identified according to the physiographic classification of mangroves. A fridge mangrove dominated by Rhizophora mangle L. in a juvenile state, with low structural development, and two types of inland or basin mangroves dominated by Avicennia germinans (L.) L. The first of them, located behind the fridge mangrove, showed high salinity in the soil and in the interstitial water, predominance of sandy sediments, and low values of height and diameter at breast height (DBH) average of the trees. The second, with a low number of adult trees in all diameter categories, high basal area, low natural regeneration potential, and high concentrations of Fe and Cu in the soil, probably associated with contamination by domestic spills. The location of the first inner mangrove behind the fridge mangrove reveals the typical zonation of many mangroves in the world. The floristic composition, structure and distribution of the mangroves in the Sanguaré Reserve are the result of the interaction of local environmental variables such as salinity and soil texture, as well as the anthropic intervention prior to the establishment of the reserve and the current human presence being very close to the mangroves. © 2019, Universidad de Costa Rica.

Plant and environment characteristics were surveyed from higher, south of Bogeda peak, to lower, north of Guerbantonggute desert. There were a total of 341 vascular plant, 295 herbage, 41 shrub, and seven tree species in the sampled plots. The plant richness of vegetation types generally showed a unimodal pattern along altitude, with a bimodal change of plant species number at 100-m intervals of altitudinal samples. The two belts of higher plant richness were in transient areas between vegetation types, the first in areas from dry grass to forest, and the second from forest to sub-alpine grass and bush. The beta diversity varied with altitudinal changes, with herbaceous species accounting for most species, and thus had similar species turnover patterns to total species. Matching the change of richness of plant species to environmental factors along altitude and correlating these by redundancy analysis revealed that the environmental factors controlling species richness and its pattern were the combined effects of temperature, precipitation, soil water, and nutrition. Water was more important at low altitude, and temperature at high altitude, and soil chemical and physical characters at middle altitudes.

With the increase of altitude, the foliar nitrogen content (especially the nitrogen content per unit leaf area, Narae) and the PNUE increased, and the foliar δ13C had a significant increase, with an increment of 1.4‰ per 1000 m altitude. The stomatal and mesophyll CO2 diffusion conductance also increased with increasing altitude, which had definite negative effect on the increase of foliar δ13C, but the effect was not strong enough. Comparing with CO2 diffusion conductance, carboxylation capacity was a more important factor limiting the Pc/Pa, and even, the foliar δ13C. At altitude 2350-2700 m, air temperature was the main factor affecting the allocation of nitrogen in S. atopantha photosynthetic system, whereas at altitude 2700-3530 m, light could be the main affecting factor.
