The designation objectives and scopes, zoning schemes, management tasks, and environmental requirements of SMPA are different from Marine Natural Reserve (MNR). Different voices from supporters and opponents were raised on this new kind of policy. For a better understanding on this policy, we analyzed SMPA and its relationship and difference with MNR, dissected development of SMPAs in China, and discussed its governance, management and experiences. The main findings are: (1) SMPA policy is a complementary strategy for MNR policy. SMPA policy can reduce the conflicts and narrow the gap between conservation and local economic development; (2) The coverage of SMPA has sharply increased since the establishment of the first national SMPA in 2005,which demonstrates the Chinese government has paid great attention to multiple-use of marine resources in order to achieve sustainable development. (3) Lack of financial funding, baseline data and scientific research are affecting the effectiveness of conservation and management of SMPA policy. In order to ameliorate the SMPA policy, we suggest (1) making overall strategic planning for multiple-use of marine resources, (2) coordinating the role of central government and local government, and considering the up-bottom system as a complement, and (3) increasing financial support from central government and local government, accumulating baseline data, and conducting systematic scientific research. Given all the features of SMPA Policy, we considered it as an emerging and key mechanism for protection of marine ecosystem and a trade-off between ecological conservation and economic development in China. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84875274111"

In addition to this commercial pressure, the impact of recreational activities on fish assemblages remains barely known. Here we examined the impact of spearfishing limitation on resources in a marine protected area (MPA) and the benefit it provides for the local artisanal fishery through the use of a novel indicator. We analysed trends in the fish assemblage composition using artisanal fisheries data collected in the Bonifacio Strait Natural Reserve (BSNR), a Mediterranean MPA where the spearfishing activity has been forbidden over 15% of its area. Fish species were pooled into three response groups according to their target level by spearfishing. We developed the new flexible ReGS indicator reflecting shifts in species assemblages according to the relative abundance of each response group facing external pressure. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) increased by ca. 60% in the BSNR between 2000 and 2007, while the MPA was established in 1999. The gain of CPUE strongly depended on the considered response group: for the highly targeted group, the CPUE doubled while the CPUE of the untargeted group increased by only 15.5%. The ReGS value significantly increased from 0.31 to 0.45 (on a scale between 0 and 1) in the general perimeter of this MPA while it has reached a threshold of 0.43, considered as a reference point, in the area protected from spearfishing since 1982. Our results demonstrated that limiting recreational fishing by appropriate zoning in multiple-use MPAs represents a real benefit for artisanal fisheries. More generally we showed how our new indicator may reveal a wide range of impacts on coastal ecosystems such as global change or habitat degradation. © 2011 Rocklin et al.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-80053108074"

In this study, we studied habitat use, preference and utilization distribution of two Gruidae species (Black-necked Cranes Grus nigricollis and Eurasian Cranes G. grus) in Huize National Natural Reserve, Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, SW China. Line transect method indicated that the anthropogenic habitat of farmland was utilized the most by these two species (>90% of flocks observed for both). But Black-necked Cranes preferred marsh to farmland and grassland while Eurasian Cranes favored grassland in our study. Nearly all the Black-necked Cranes (99.30% of the flocks observed) utilized habitats in the core area of the reserve, covering an area of 283.84 ha close to the common roost. Eurasian Cranes were mostly (55.39% of the flocks observed) distributed in the buffer zone with higher elevation and further distance to the roost, covering an area of 558.73 ha. We believe that our findings could help guide habitat management, functional zoning planning and adjustment in the future. According to our results, we recommended restoration of more wetlands, retain large areas of farmland, and protect the areas that cranes use most frequently. © 2018 PeerJ Inc..

However, its development presents several challenging features. Sometimes, the biological aspects of the protected areas are poorly considered in the final zoning, which becomes a controversial issue, since the biological conservation is the main objective of these areas. Herein, we propose an index to evaluate the biological relevance of different landscape units (Biological Importance Value - BIV), specially tailored for the zoning of protected areas. We also present a case study where the BIV was used for zoning the Serra do Tombador Natural Reserve (RNST). A layer of spatial information was produced attributing a BIV value for each landscape entity. This layer was included in a weighted overlay framework with the vegetation types, hydrograph, and roads. We found eight different biological relevance levels in the RNST. These values composed the basis for the final reserve zoning. The BIV associated with the weighted overlay framework reflected the observed faunal distribution in the area and represents an important tool for the implementation of protected areas management practices. © 2014 by Unisinos.","Biological relevance index; Protected areas zoning; Serra do Tombador Natural Reserve; Weighted overlay","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901397566"

They have various ecological functions, such as protecting biodiversity, conserving water sources, and purifying the atmosphere. However, with the rapid development of the social economy, human disturbance in natural reserves is becoming increasingly pronounced, which has seriously damaged the initial balance of the ecosystem in the reserves. Based on the specific local conditions of the reserve, this study selects four influencing factors that are closely related to human activities, namely, land use, vegetation cover, slope and elevation as the primary evaluation indicators of human disturbance. With the support of an analytic hierarchy process and GIS technology, this study conducts a comprehensive analysis of human disturbance in the Fujian Huangchulin Nature Reserve and proposes corresponding ecological restoration measures for different disturbed areas. The results indicate that the area that is seriously and completely disturbed by human activities is primarily that around the river basin, which accounts for 25.30% of the total area. The lightly disturbed area covers the largest area, followed by the intermediately disturbed area, which accounts for 37.91% and 32.96% of the total area, respectively. The smallest area is slightly disturbed and accounts for only 3.83% of the total area. Based on the comprehensive analytical results of human disturbance and the functional zoning of the natural reserves in China, the Shitan Stream area in the Huangchulin Nature Reserve is selected as the experimental site for ecological restoration. According to the human disturbance in different sectors of the Shitan Stream area and the concept of “Mountain, Water, Forest, Field, Lake and Grass,” the ecological restoration measures of the “Four-tiered Protection System” are proposed in the experiment, which are the river system restoration, brownfield restoration, soil and water conservation, and original ecological protection areas. Natural regeneration and active restoration are then combined to be implemented in different areas, and the ecological problems of brown land pollution, water system cutoff, and soil erosion have been effectively solved, and the plant coverage increased substantially. In summary, this study shows that only by taking social, economic and ecological factors into account and establishing a sound management system can restoration work proceed smoothly and achieve more environmental benefits. © 2023 by the authors.","analytic hierarchy process; ecological restoration; GIS; human disturbance; natural reserve","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147952212"

Further surveys in the mid 1990s and early 2000s showed key species were still present and could be conserved. Following a report on these surveys the Ministry of Environment established the Itombwe Reserve in 2006 without consulting local communities who have legitimate customary rights to reside within the area and use the region's natural resources. Although creating the Reserve was within the government's legal authority, its establishment violated the rights of the people there. Here we report over a decade of work by a consortium of international and national human rights and conservation NGOs, the local communities and the protected areas authority (Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature), to remediate this taking of customary rights. Starting in 2008 these partners began a participatory process with all 550 villages within and around the boundary of the Reserve. Using a community resource use mapping approach, developed from best practices, the team helped communities determine the boundary of the Reserve, and then pilot participatory zoning to identify zones for settlements, agriculture, hunting, gathering of non-timber forest products, and conservation. This process secured the customary rights of long-term residents in the Reserve and protected their lands from being taken by non-rights holders. As a result of this work the use rights of communities were largely restored and the communities agreed on 23 June 2016 to formalize the boundaries of the renamed Itombwe Nature Reserve. © 2018 Fauna and Flora International.","Biodiversity; community engagement; conflict resolution; Democratic Republic of Congo; DRC; Itombwe Reserve; protected area establishment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041577932"

Then the framework was built by incorporating remote sensing and GIS techniques. On that basis, the function zoning of the Chongming Dongtan National Natural Reserve was studied by utilizing the eCognition object-oriented image segmentation method and spatial fuzzy assessment model, and obtained the following results:(1) Core zone, buffer zone 1, buffer zone 2, and transition zone accounted for 18.0%, 13.2%, 18.4%, and 50.4% of the total area of the nature reserve, respectively, which is better than previous function zoning both in spatial distribution and ecological sense; (2)The remote sensing images and its derived data make that the ecological environment of the reserve understandable on the macroscale and long-term scale, promote the time-effectiveness and reliability, but decrease the fieldwork intensity to a great extent; (3) The fusion of modern GIS techniques and traditional mathematical models has a good prospect in reserve planning.

Coupled with increasing socioeconomic development, most of the rapidly developing and transitional countries and regions have been experiencing dramatic land use changes. This has resulted in a large amount of forestland, grassland, and wetland being occupied as residential and industrial land or reclaimed for arable land, which in turn results in a sharp deterioration of ecosystem services around the world. Shandong Province, an economically powerful province of China, was chosen as a case study in order to capture the impact of socioeconomic development on ecosystem services. By way of the study, land uses and their changes were categorized between 1980 and 2006, and the ecosystem services capital and changes of 111 counties of Shandong Province in different phases were evaluated, as well as the total ecosystem services capital, followed by the zoning of ecosystem services function region of Shandong Province. We found that the counties in mountainous areas and wetlands, where generally the prefectural-level cities are located with a rapid socioeco-nomic development, experienced a successive deterioration of ecosystem services especially during the 2000s. Finally, three conservation strategies for managing and improving ecosystem services were proposed and discussed with the aim of achieving coordinate and sustainable development of the socioeconomy, environment, and ecosystems not only in Shandong Province but also in other provinces of China, as well as in other developing and transitional countries and regions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Ecosystem services function regions; Ecosystem services value; Natural reserves; Payments for ecosystem services; Shandong province; Sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862888534"

It is comprised of unique land-use systems and agricultural landscapes formed by long-term co-evolution and dynamic adaptation of rural communities and their environment. IAHS sites are rich in biodiversity and support of local socio-economic and cultural development. They also play a positive role in coordinating community livelihoods and ecological protection through their soil and water management strategies, knowledge systems, and cultural connotations. Therefore, it is of great significance to assess the value of IAHS for adaptive IAHS management per se, as well as optimizing the protected area system and its zoning-based management according to human-environment interactions. Our study first reviewed the value systems of related concepts, focusing on natural resource assets, ecosystem functions and services, and various types of natural and cultural heritage to generalize the value typology and assessment methods for heritage systems and their key elements. We then examined the uniqueness of IAHS based on our understanding of the general agricultural heritage systems (AHS) and the more specific Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) to ensure that characteristics such as complexity, vitality, and strategy were fully reflected in the value system. IAHS is comprised of both material and non-material parts. Its' complexity indicates the assimilation of values from natural and cultural heritage, as well as cultural landscapes. Vitality implies the system's dynamics based on its historical and current value as an adaptive system. Strategy defines the positive externality of IAHS towards people beyond its local area, determining its contribution to regional and global sustainable development strategies. Afterwards, the value typology of IAHS was proposed. The value system was firstly divided into existence and potential values to reflect the impact of IAHS on the current and future generation. The existence value was further separated into carrier and service values. The carrier value is the intrinsic value based on the physical formation of agricultural land as an asset stock during its historical period. The service value is the measure of flow from the stock. It is composed of nine values, namely the product value, ecological value, sci-tech value, social value, aesthetic value, cultural value, historical value, spiritual value, and brand value, and is further divided to 25 value elements at the lowest level. We also proposed possible evaluation methods and statistical approaches targeting at potential indicators of the existence value to obtain the monetary value of certain IAHS to better implement this multi-layered value system in policy making and conservation management. Key methods were selected from practices that evaluated ecosystem services, farmland, and natural resources, including the direct marketing method, substitutable marketing method, and simulated market method. Non-material value elements, which usually were only valued quantitatively, were discussed to determine the difficulty and possibility of quantitative accounting. As a result, the value typology can help managers identify IAHS conservation focal points according to the value connotation. The existence value must be well preserved. The potential value should be further studied. The conservation of the carrier value is mainly dependent on local farmland protection. Some service values benefiting large areas are better protected via regional cooperation. As a result, this research revealed the values embedded in human-environment interactions in the IAHS and interpreted their importance in maintaining a harmony between human and environment; thus providing a theoretical basis for spatial integration and management optimization of protected areas, as well as coordinative decision-making for regional conservation and development. It also provided a whole set of value systems and evaluation methods for the monetary value of IAHS; synthesized from quantitative or qualitative methods used in ecosystem services, natural resources assets, natural and cultural heritages, and brands. © 2020, Science Press.

We studied the wintering habitat use, preference, and utilization distribution of two crane species, that is, the black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis, Przevalski, 1876) and common crane (Grus grus, Linnaeus, 1758), in Huize National Natural Reserve, Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, southwestern China. Line transects indicated that anthropogenic farmland habitat was highly utilized and was positively selected by both crane species (> 90% of flocks observed for both species). Black-necked cranes preferred marshland in spring (February and March) but avoided grassland during the entire wintering period, whereas common cranes avoided both marshland and grassland throughout the entire period. The two cranes species had communal nightly roosting sites and separate daily foraging sites. Black-necked cranes were distributed within two km (1.89 ± 0.08 km) of the roosting site, covering an area of 283.84 ha, with the core distribution area encompassing less than 100 ha. In contrast, common cranes were distributed far from the roosting site (4.38 ± 0.11 km), covering an area of 558.73 ha, with the core distribution area encompassing 224.81 ha. Thus, interspecies competition may have influenced the habitat preference and spatial distribution divergence of these two phylogenetically related species. This study should help guide habitat management as well as functional zoning development and adjustment in the future. Based on our results, we recommend restoration of additional wetlands, retention of large areas of farmland, and protection of areas that cranes use most frequently. © 2018 Kong et al.","Coexistence; Grus grus; Grus nigricollis; Habitat management; Habitat use; Spatial distribution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050237664"

In this study, we sought to identify the conservation areas of wild C. salsa by considering multiple host–plant interactions and climate change conditions using the MaxEnt model. Additionally, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the autocorrelation between environmental variables. The effects of the natural distribution of the host plants in terms of natural distribution from the perspective of niche similarities and extrapolation detection were considered by filtering the most influential hosts: Krascheninnikovia ceratoides (Linnaeus), Gueldenstaedt, and Nitraria sibirica Pall. Additionally, the change trends in these hosts based on climate change conditions combined with the change trends in C. salsa were used to identify a core protection area of 126483.5 km2. In this article, we corrected and tried to avoid some of the common mistakes found in species distribution models based on the findings of previous research and fully considered the effects of host plants for multiple-host holoparasitic plants to provide a new perspective on the prediction of holoparasitic plants and to provide scientific zoning for biodiversity conservation in desert ecosystems. This research will hopefully serve as a significant reference for decision-makers. Copyright © 2022 Shao, Fan, Ma and Wang.","Cistanche salsa (C. A. Mey.) G.

In the areas around Chaohu Lake of China, the rapid industrialization and urbanization have led to ecological health problems, such as water quality deterioration, vegetation degradation and ecosystem degeneration. This paper aims to give some advices on achieving the healthy development of water ecosystem based on spatial development and regulation zoning in the areas around Chaohu Lake. After building the evaluation index system composed of water ecological sensitivity and water ecological pressure, this paper discusses the methods of spatial zoning which is related to both regional development and ecological environment protection, based on 500 m×500 m grid units and ArcGIS software, as well as the comprehensive evaluation of single factor and multifactor analysis. The areas around Chaohu Lake, serving as a case study, are divided into four types by the method of two-dimensional quadrant analysis, namely, high-sensitivity and high-pressure area, high-sensitivity and low-pressure area, low-sensitivity and high-pressure area, and low-sensitivity and low-pressure area, representing 2.66%, 20.46%, 13.01 and 63.87% of the total area respectively. Different measures are put forward according to different types of areas. Firstly, the areas around Chaohu Lake generally should adopt a policy on low density development prioritizing the ecological and cultural protection. As an important drinking water source and ecological barrier areas in Chaohu and Hefei city, the areas around Chaohu Lake is expected to give a strict protection of the natural reserve, existing mountain, water and wetland landscape, forest parks, scenic areas, lake shelterbelts and so on. Secondly, learning from previous lessons on the development models of lakeside districts in other regions and countries, the development model in the areas around Chaohu Lake should adopt appropriate measures suiting local conditions: the belts along the main rivers into Chaohu Lake have the higher sensitivity to water environment, are not suitable for large-scale development and construction, and need to strengthen the ecological restoration and environmental protection. Thirdly, the northern Binhu new district of Hefei city, Chaohu city and their towns have higher pressures on water ecosystem from high-density development activities, is in urgent needs of the model transformation and structure upgrade in industrial and urban development, and implements strict access standards to environmental and pollution emissions. Lastly, although some regions with lower ecological sensitivity and pressure can adopt different measures and development models relying on local resources and their own advantages, a strict control of new emissions of pollutants and maintenance of healthy development of ecological water are of prime importance. © 2018 Science Press.

This study uses multiple index coupling models to evaluate the suitability of construction land. The evaluation uses mountain disaster risk, topographic and geomorphic environments, hydrogeological environments, human activity factors and socio-economic factors as the suitability standards. We use geographic information system (GIS) technology to improve the evaluation model and establish a suitability map of construction land for Baoxing County, Sichuan province, China. This study indicates that the mountain disaster risk is the core factor of the suitability zoning of construction land in Baoxing County, wherein, the development suitability of construction land in the central sectors is relatively high while the mountain disaster risk is relatively high due to the high socioeconomic value of the disaster-bearing areas in the central sectors. The development suitability of construction land near the fracture zones and the natural reserves is relatively low. © 2018, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Construction land; Mountain disasters; Risk assessment; Suitability assessment; Vulnerability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056176701"

The topic becomes interesting in light of the most popular world practices to develop nature-oriented tourism and recreation in special protected natural areas. Specific spatial consequences for the sustainable development as for urbanized areas both for reserves are discovered. The territory of a reserve becomes a place of environmental stress (consider the goals of nature reservation), as well as social conflicts due to human stakeholders “values” diverse. The possibility of a compromise between the conservation imperative and the touristic one in the natural reserves use, the search for solutions to reduce the negative impact on protected natural areas remains one of the most important tasks. We wonder if there is a solution for the competitive nature management for nature territories. In the course of research and evaluation of tourist and recreational flow in the Kurgalsky Reserve in the Leningrad Region, we identified patterns of various types of tourist and recreational activities (local recreation, dacha recreation, amateur tourism) territorial organization and their accompanying forms. We assessed their impact on the natural complexes of the reserve. As a result, the types of territories for recreational use within the boundaries of the reserve were identified, differing by types of recreational activity and groups of vacationers. The stages of digression of natural areas of tourist and recreational use were identified. The possibility to combine the obtained results and the Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC) method usage are under discussion in this paper. The results obtained can be used in reserves zoning and spatial planning, for the reserves master plans development that ensure to fulfill both environmental and recreational goals, can be helpful to Integrate environmental consideration in tourism development policies. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

The zoning and patterned accumulation of elements in lichen thallus is one of the important factors influencing lichen element concentrations. We collected an epigenous fruticose lichen Cladonia rangiferina (CR) from a remote site of Huzhong National Natural Reserve, Heilongjiang, NE China. Fifty-five elements (Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Dy, Er, Eu, Fe, Gd, Ge, Hg, Ho, K, La, Li, Lu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Nd, Ni, P, Pb, Pr, Rb, S, Sb, Sc, Se, Si, Sm, Sn, Sr, Tb, Th, Ti, Tl, Tm, U, V, Y, Yb, and Zn) were measured with their differences among 3 parts (upper, middle, and lower) of the podetia compared. The aim of the present study was to examine the vertical patterns of element accumulation in CR. The results display a very low degree of atmospheric element deposition in the study site. Concentrations of most elements of limited metabolic significance generally increase from the upper to lower parts, indicating a continuous bioaccumulation of these elements with exposure time. Concentrations of some nutrients have little vertical difference among parts (Zn), and they are higher in the upper part than in the middle part (K, P, and S), or are similar between the upper and middle parts (B, Cu and Mg). These results suggest a nutrient translocation to the more biologically active young part. Our results highlight the importance of selecting the suitable parts of lichen thallus to increase the comparability of data in lichen biomonitoring studies. © 2020, HARD Publishing Company.

Urban landscapes will be more ecologically sustainable where key habitat structures (e.g. trees, shrubs and woody debris) that support multiple taxa are maintained. Yet, there is little empirical data on the extent to which habitat structures have been modified in urban landscapes. Obtaining these data is a necessary first step towards reducing the ecological impacts of urbanisation. This is because urban practitioners can use this information to formulate more targeted management policies and conservation strategies that seek to better maintain and perpetuate habitat structures in urban landscapes. We compared the availability of multiple habitat structures in urban greenspace, agricultural land, and semi-natural reserves in Canberra, southeastern Australia. In urban greenspace, the density and/or probability of occurrence of trees, seedlings, dead trees, hollow-bearing trees, hollows, logs and native ground and mid-storey vegetation were significantly lower compared with reserves, but comparable with agricultural land. Our results highlight an urgent need for improved habitat protection policies, management strategies, and on-the-ground conservation actions that aim to retain and restore key habitat structures in urban landscapes. To achieve this requires innovative strategies that balance socio-economic priorities and biodiversity conservation. We propose three strategies that can be practically implemented in cities worldwide including: (1) establishing dedicated conservation areas; (2) spatially zoning habitat structures hazardous to humans within existing urban greenspaces, and (3) educating key stakeholders about the importance of habitat structures within urban environments. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Human-habitat conflict; Southeastern Australia; Urban conservation planning; Urban greenspace; Urbanisation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84898890444"

The results showed that: (1) the construction land increased rapidly since 1991 and reached 24,951.21 km2 in 2008, or 21.27% of the total area. Among all the cities in the YRD, Shanghai took the greatest percentage, followed by Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Spatially, areas where government departments are located became the growth center of construction land. Prefecture-level cities were the fastest growth region and the changing trend showed circle layered characteristics and significant increase with Shanghai and Suzhou as the core. (2) The higher the quality of construction land potentials (CLP), the smaller the number of CLP units. High sensitive area accounted for the largest percentage (40.14%) among all types of constraint regions and this was followed by medium sensitive region (31.53%) of the whole region. (3) The comprehensive CLP in the YRD was 24,989.65 km2, or 21.76% of the total YRD. The land use potential showed spatial distribution imbalance. CLP of Zhejiang was obviously larger than that of Jiangsu. CLP was insufficient in regional central city. Moreover, CLP in the YRD formed a circle layered spatial pattern that increasingly expanded centered in prefecture-level cities. Low potential area expanded from north to south. High potential area was mainly located in south YRD. Areas with zero potential in the YRD formed a northwest-southeast “Y-shaped” spatial pattern in north Hangzhou Bay. (4) CLP per capita in YRD was 0.045 ha/person and also unevenly distributed. Some 25.57% of the study units at county level nearly had no construction land and 8.24% of the units had CLP per capita below the national average level. CLP per capita in less than 25% of the county-level units was larger than the YRD average level, which were mainly located in Zhejiang. Therefore, research on the construction potential area in YRD was favorable for analysis of the development status and potential space of this region under the background of rapid urbanization and industrialization. © 2015, Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","construction land use; potential zoning; spatial expansion; Yangtze River Delta","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946161213"

To further strengthen the integrated management of coastal zone and explore more efficient methods of ecological space control, ten factors, namely soil erosion, desertification, soil salinization, typhoon disaster, rainstorm and flood disaster, special habitat, storm surge, disastrous wave, coastal erosion, and red tide, were selected to evaluate the eco-environmental sensitivity of the coastal zone in Lingao County, Hainan Province. Earthquake, collapse, landslide, land subsidence, and sand liquefaction were considered in the risk assessment of geological hazards. The results derived from eco-environmental sensitivity and risk assessment of geological hazards were combined with territorial planning to analyze the deep spatial management zoning of the study area. The results indicated that: 1) Desertification, soil salinization, rainstorm and flood disaster, red tide, and coastal erosion were mainly slightly sensitive; soil erosion and typhoon disaster were mainly moderately sensitive; and special habitat, storm surge, and disastrous wave were highly sensitive. The area of moderate, high, and extreme-high comprehensive sensitivity zone was 9 682.11, 3 275.29, and 983.88 hm2, respectively. Among them, Diaolou Town had the largest distribution area in the highly sensitive zone, and Bohou Town had the most widely distributed area in the extreme-highly sensitive zone. 2) The main geological hazards were earthquake, collapse, landslide, land subsidence, and sand liquefaction. Except for the seismic risk, which was divided into high-risk zone and middle zone, the other four types only had medium-risk and low-risk zones. The comprehensive risk zones were classified as high, medium, and low, among which the risk areas were mainly distributed in the 15 m area on each side of the fault zone of Bohou, Dongying, Bolian, and Huangtong Town, with a total area of 118.86 hm2. 3) The development and utilization of the coastal zone in Lingao County may be divided into three levels. The first level includes specific protected zone, moderate development zone, and intensive development zone. The second level included eight zones, including natural reserves, retention zone, utilization zone in control, agricultural development zone, tourism and leisure zone, public facility zone, residential construction zone, and industrial zone. The third level consisted of 18 tertiary divisions. 4) The deep spatial management zoning of the coastal zone with multiple horizons of ecological sensitivity, geological hazard risk, and territorial planning can better identify important protection objects and key protection areas and enable the coastal zone to be fully developed and utilized. Although this paper attempted to diagnose and identify the intensity and spatial distribution of various eco-environmental sensitivity types in the coastal zone from the views of quantification and visualization, some problems need to be explored further in the process of application, such as index selection, model construction, data acquisition, synergistic influence among different ecological environment sensitivity types, and so on. Moreover, the visual expression of geological hazard formation mechanism in the coastal zone and the commonness and individuality of the quantitative measurement of potential geological hazard risk assessment are also aspects that need to be strengthened. © 2020 Tropical Geography.
