The current research focuses on the prioritizing of elements which contribute to the spread of fire and the special zoning of potentially dangerous areas in addition to the pinpointing of locations for the establishment of fire stations in forested areas in the Shimbar national reserve based on historical data spanning 2001 to 2018. The study utilizes elements (physiological, vegetation cover, meteorological, anthropological factors) contributing to wildfires as inputs into an artificial neural network and the development of a fuzzy inference system in order to produce fire zoning maps for the region under study. The map is divided into five sectors, i.e., minimum, low, moderate, high, and maximum risk of fire. The validation of the fire zoning map was evaluated at 0.83 and the RMSE error was 0.75. The results obtained show that 20% of the area under study is within the average risk category, 11% is within the high-risk category, and 10% is within the very high-risk category of a potential fire hazard. The most important variables were distance from a flowing source, i.e., river or stream, the land formation type, elevation, and the minimum temperature. The identification of suitable locations for firefighting stations was carried out by merging the fuzzy inference system model and Arc GIS, and the results obtained defined 16 possible locations. It was concluded that the application of hybrid models when dealing with the aforementioned variables is effective when seeking to determine locations for the establishment of firefighting stations and rural safety services; moreover, such hybrid models are highly efficacious for determining of fire hazard zones. It is proposed that hybrid models be applied on a large scale for the prevention, control, and management of fires throughout the country. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial neural network; Fuzzy inference system; Geographical information system; Potential fires; Risk","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146296615"

The geospatial analysis is used for Khortytsia National Reserve territory zoning. GIS environment allows combination of volunteer spatial data (Open Street map, wikiloc.com), remote sensing data, represent it visually and prepare for decisions making. The paper explains the map creation process for the location of recreation resources (beaches, shrubs, forest, grasslands, rocks, river landscapes, historical and cultural points of interest in the Khortytsia National Reserve). The geospatial analysis allows distinguishing four functional zones: natural or semi-natural landscapes, tourist infrastructure, historical heritage, leisure. The information obtained in this study is one step towards landscape planning and territory use optimization. The algorithm proposed can help Khortytsia National Reserve staff manage the reserve territory. © 2022 EAGE. All Rights Reserved.","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159322800"
